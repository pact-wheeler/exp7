        <p>How to I make cabinets level?</p>

            <li>Level the toe cabinet using shims, build your cabinets square and set them on top, here&#39;s <a

        <p>What axe should I use?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depends on what you&#39;re doing, if you&#39;re splitting wood, you want a maul, Fiskars is pretty good.
                If you are doing bush craft, probably a boys axe and probably from <a

        <p>What tools do I need to start woodworking?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What type of projects do you want to do? Buy tools for that. (This is true for any creative
                    endeavor).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you don&#39;t have ANY tools, here are some general thoughts if you&#39;re going the power tool
                    route. I prefer corded tools, since I do most of my work in the shop. </p>
                <p>If I were starting over, I would buy a decent circular corded saw and make a (basically) <a
                        href='https://www.outoftheww.com/projects/circular-saw-track-saw-guide' target="_blank">free track</a> for it
                    and a sliding miter saw, I have one from Bosch and love it. </p>
                <p>The best way to not over-buy is to purchase the tools that you need. Look at what you can do with
                    hand tools as well, a sharp set of (1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 or their equivalent metric) chisels can replace
                    a ton of other small tools that perform the same function. </p>

                    another that uses magnets. </p>
                <p>Run it along your wall until you find a nail. Verify by moving the the magnet up and down along the
                    wall. If you need a reference for how walls are built, here&#39;s a <a

                    you are saving a file and use the same shortcut (Ctrl-J), it&#39;s formatted in &quot;yyyymmdd&quot;

        <p>Daniel, what are some purchases that have made a huge difference in your life?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MX Master Mouse</li>
            <li>A good mechanical keyboard - make sure you have quieter switches if you&#39;ll be in a shared
                environment</li>
            <li>I own only one kind of sock</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How should I read business &amp; self help books?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly, skip over the stories. You can get through a most books that are fluffed up in about 2 or 3
                hours. </li>

                but not a ton and not every time you wash it. If you need to season it, follow the directions on that

        <p>How do I get good at Microsoft Excel?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>I&#39;m so glad you asked! Learn to use shortcuts, get an MX Master. Start to think programatically,
                    look for patterns in your data. Look for problems that are interesting for <em>you</em> to solve.
                    Take a workbook that&#39;s done well and try to figure out how it was made.</p>
                <p>Learn how to debug formulas and step through them. </p>
                <p><a href='https://www.youtube.com/@MyOnlineTrainingHub'target="_blank">Mynda Treacy</a> and <a
                        href='https://www.youtube.com/@excelisfun'target="_blank">Mike Girvin</a> are all really good folks to follow
                    and their tutorials are some of the best in my opinion. </p>

        <p>What do you think about ChatGPT and LLM?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It&#39;s interesting, but as with a lot of new technology people are still figuring out how to use it
                    and how it might be useful (i.e. monetize). The image generation is probably stealing and lawsuits
                    will probably go in favor of the artists. </p>
                <p>There&#39;s a lot of hype that eventually people will see for the hot air it is. I&#39;ve seen a lot
                    of obviously AI written articles come out, after a few paragraphs into them, and they are mostly
                    garbage. </p>
                <p>That&#39;s true when it is in my domain, for things outside my domain or thing less verifiable, that
                    becomes more difficult. Question/answer forums are starting to ban AI generated content, which will
                    become a battle over time. </p>

        <p>What&#39;s the best kind of wood finish?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I like soap finish, recipe is super simple, it&#39;s very easy to maintain and I&#39;m not burning my
                lungs doing it. No PPE is nice. </li>
