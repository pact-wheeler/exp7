        <h1>Finding Faith</h1>
        <section>
            <p>A few months into fatherhood, I realized that I don’t know if I’m a
Christian. I don’t doubt that the Bible is true, that a worldview
centered on Christ is the way to eternal life, but what I do have an
question is whether or not I am God’s child.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t God speak to his kid, at least once in awhile?</p>
<p>I’ll be writing essays and book reviews to record what I learn while
reading following books and putting some of the things into practice. As
I write based on these questions (What is the author saying? Is it
correct? Cite text. Do you agree? How does this connect with other
related thoughts? <a
href="https://talesfortadpoles.ie/products/sam-mcbratney-guess-how-much-i-love-you">Source</a>
- which was <em>very</em> difficult to find, come on Sam.), each of
these books will include a link to my notes as well as a non-Amazon
link.</p>
<section id="how-to-read-the-bible" class="level2">
<h2>How to Read The Bible</h2>
<p>The first book is <a
href="https://www.dankimball.com/how-not-to-read-the-bible">How not to
read your bible by Dan Kimball</a>, this book is in here because of some
of the podcasts I’ve listened to, specifically by <a
href="https://hebraicthought.org/authors/rabbi-dr-ari-lamm/">Ari
Lamm</a>, and I’ve picked up how westerners have misinterpreted a lot of
what the Bible in fact is pointing to as hard as it can, with the
conventions it has. The second book is <a
href="https://www.ivpress.com/saving-the-bible-from-ourselves">Saving
the Bible from Ourselves by Glenn Pauuw</a>, this book hopefully
directly answers the questions “What have I gotten wrong about the
Bible? Where do most in the American traditions miss something
important?”</p>
<p>The next book is <a href="https://www.derwinlgray.com/gdyhm-lp">God,
Do You Hear Me by Derwin Gray</a>, which I expect to preach to the part
of me that says, something to the effect of “God doesn’t hear you.”
Finally, <a
href="https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/faculty/john-walton/">Wisdom for
Faithful Reading by John Walton</a>, this one is more academic, just
based on who John Walton is and his bibliography.</p>
</section>
<section id="porn" class="level2">
<h2>Porn</h2>
<p><a
href="https://www.wheaton.edu/academics/faculty/william-struthers/">Wired
for Intimacy by William Struthers</a> answers the question about what
happens to someone’s brain on porn and what the purpose of those
pathways were originally designed for. In America, this is a problem,
one third of all web traffic was for pornography, something like 70% of
men regularly consume pornography.</p>
<p>A dear friend recommended the <a
href="https://www.423communities.org/pursuitofporneia">The Pursuit of
Pornia by Dave Scriven</a>, read my review here soon. Though I’ve just
discovered in ground work for this short essay, <a
href="https://fightthenewdrug.org/about/">fight the new drug</a> seems
like it might have some really interesting resources related this
topic.</p>
</section>
<section id="habits" class="level2">
<h2>Habits</h2>
<p>For the third year in a row, I went to a physical therapist starting
in November last year. In the last few weeks I’ve changed over to seeing
a fitness coach because I’m tired of treating symptoms, I want to fix
the cause. I’ve read and strongly recommend Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg, but
I’ll be reading Your Future Self Will Thank You by Drew Dyck, I’m
looking to the traditions by reading both The Celebration of Discipline
and Learning Humility by <a
href="https://renovare.org/people/richard-foster">Richard
Foster</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="politics" class="level2">
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>Politics has been a thorn in my side for the longest time, I hate how
worked up and blind people get. I’ve listened to Kaitlyn Scheiss on the
Holy Post a lot and appreciate the way she thinks and approaches
problem. A few years back she wrote <a
href="https://kaitlynschiess.com/theballotandthebible">The Ballot and
the Bible</a> and I’ve been looking forward to reading it since. It’s
been just taking up shelf space in the mean time.</p>
</section>
<section id="heart" class="level2">
<h2>Heart</h2>
<p>For 3 years in a row my sister has recommended <a
href="https://www.daneortlund.com/gentle-lowly">Gentle and Lowly by Dane
Ortland</a> and I recently read <a
href="https://curtthompsonmd.com/books/">The Deepest Place by Curt
Thompson.</a></p>
<p>With all of these my goal is to at the very least write an SRQ
(Summary, Response, Questions), but perhaps a bit more.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of books, but if you’re wired the way I am, sometimes you
don’t know what else to do.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">thats a lot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But I’ve learned something in the last few years; I can’t just study
the Bible alone. I need a community around me; it isn’t and cannot be
just me and Jesus. Even Jesus didn’t do that. None of the apostles were
alone. If I don’t have people around me, then I’m not following the
example of the Church or Jesus’ commands.</p>
<p>I’m broken and need to see Jesus through other broken people, in
Christ’s Church.</p>
<p>The American church has problems. It has Christian Nationalists, <a
href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/frenchpress/they-arent-who-you-think-they-are/">Camp
Kanakuk</a>, <a
href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2021/february/ravi-zacharias-rzim-investigation-sexual-abuse-sexting-rape.html">Ravi
Zacharias</a>, <a
href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill/">Mark
Driscoll</a>, and in my own town <a
href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2023/aug/18/ex-pastor-john-bishop-returns-to-vancouver-to-publicly-confess-apologize/">Living
Hope</a>, and <a
href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2025/feb/20/vancouver-woman-sues-new-heights-church-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-by-former-pastor/">New
Heights</a>. The last few years the church has been rocked by scandal, I
tried to document more than just these two from my local area but was
quickly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But then on the opposite end of the spectrum you have thoughtful
Christians, <a href="https://thedispatch.com/author/david-french/">David
French</a> in particular, <a
href="https://katelynbeaty.substack.com/">Katelyn Beaty,</a> the <a
href="https://voxologypodcast.com/">Voxology Podcast</a>, the Holy Post,
Christian Taylor, Jemar Tisby, and many others.</p>
