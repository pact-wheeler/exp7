        <h1>Liar</h1>
        <section>
            <p>My pastor today preached on the ten commandments. It was a banger but
sometimes there’s a quick aside, a word of explanation that is aside
from the main point that is wrong. Obviously, I’m not going to be
asinine and point it out to him, after the fact. I don’t want him to
know I actually listen.</p>
<p>But what is this commandment? Is it it lying?</p>
<p>I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Do not bear false witness would be lying.</p>
<p>Do not bear false witness <em>against</em> your neighbor (emphasis
mine, duh they didn’t have italics in Hebrew) is to degrade your
neighbor. Let’s look at examples</p>
<section id="the-bible" class="level2">
<h2>The Bible</h2>
<p>So did John lie when the pharisees asked him if he was Elijah or if
they should wait for someone else?
<label for="mn-john" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-john" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> John 1, Matthew 11, Malichi 4</span></p>
<p>Did David sin when he pretended to be insane? Or did Nathan sin when
he deceived David that he was talking about someone else?
<label for="mn-david" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-david" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> 1 Samuel 21, 2 Samuel 12</span></p>
<p>Did the left handed assassin sin when he killed the king of Judah?
<label for="mn-assassin" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-assassin" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> Judges 3-4</span></p>
<p>Did Joseph sin when he deceived his brothers and wrongly accused his
youngest brother Benjamin of stealing?</p>
<p>Did the Midwives in Egypt sin when they told Pharoah that they
couldn’t kill the Jewish babies?
<label for="mn-midwives" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-midwives" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> Exodus 1</span></p>
<p>Did Rahab sin when she lied for the spies?</p>
</section>
<section id="history" class="level2">
<h2>History</h2>
<p><label for="mn-ur" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-ur" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> The underground railroad was a network of safe
spaces to transport people who were enslaved to a safer home. It existed
roughly from 1780 to 1865 </span> Did Christians sin by hiding people
who were enslaved in America in the 18th and 19th century?</p>
<p>Christians in China under Mao</p>
<p><label for="mn-9066" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-9066" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote"> Military zones were created in California,
Washington and Oregon—states with a large population of Japanese
Americans. Then Roosevelt’s executive order forcibly removed Americans
of Japanese ancestry from their homes. Executive Order 9066 affected the
lives about 120,000 people—the majority of whom were American
citizens.</span> If Christians hid their neighbors because of their
Asian descent. Would that have been a sin? There’s some evidence that
this did happen, especially among the Quakers.</p>

<h2>So We Can Lie Whenever We Want?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. What we can do is protect our negihbors, love our
neighbors with a charity that surpasses boundaries of my tribe and
“other.”</p>
