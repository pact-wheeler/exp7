<p>Peres divided the roasted berries from darkest to lightest in a tray
that had twelve wells. Darkness pressed to the windows, all fowl and
forest creatures slept. Peres had done this for thousands of hours
before and would continue to until he stopped practicing alchemy.
Bifocals rested on the end of his nose, he held in his hands two metal
knives that were dull. Their grip was a comfortable for the task, some
kind of burled dark wood with curls of white in it. A white gas lamp lit
his work. When he was young, the master he learned under insisted this
work be done in daylight, but candlelight was inconsistent and you’d
often find that the divisions of the berries were wrong. It would be
mostly right, but you’d have to check any work done by candlelight twice
and sometimes, depending on how rested you were, time was better spent
doing other things.</p>
<p>But that was a lifetime ago, now Peres was on the chamber of
guildmasters. He had trained a dozen alchemists. The better sort of
alchemy, if the other guild could be called alchemy at all. Commoners
called both magics alchemy, but that was calling water and blood the
same, or gold and lead. Were they both heavy? Yes, but lead was used for
the meanest purpose and the other was a prize that monarchs sought.</p>
<p>Peres would never deny that leaves had power, he had seen it himself.
Seen the dreams, but he knew that it was wrong in his heart. Mixing
sleep and flow was too close to the firmament that held the waters back.
If that barrier broke, who knew, the next age? Or would all be lost.</p>
<p>The orders he had would do for the lightest roast of the berries and
then a drop of liquor at the end. Young alchemists often adulterated the
drinks orders of magnitude wrong. They could follow prescribed recipes
but they had no patience for research, nor the stomach for failed
recipes. Flow had stolen weeks and two months once, from Peres but then
he came back to himself, and wrote down his experiences. The guild
benefited from his experiment an inestimable value, alchemy required not
lack of fear, but the willingness to go into that unknown. To be
consumed by the water and believe you would eventually come back up.</p>
<p>“Instructor Peres?” A young woman softly knocked on the door and
poked her head through the open door. “Yes, Syntyche, what is it?” “The
Chamber is meeting, they bid me fetch you.” “Is it that time?” Peres
said more to himself than her.</p>
<p>He stood and slowly put each group of berries into a sealed
container. If it hadn’t been Syntyche they sent, they would have offered
to do this for him while he went to the Chamber. Instead, she grabbed
jars and the rest so that he could finish his task. No sense in leaving
it undone for another time, either tomorrow or even later tonight.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard your summons child, I will be with the Chamber in my own
time.” “I cannot leave,” she spoke clearly, carefully. Her voice was
slightly deeper for a woman. Peres didn’t struggle understanding it as
he did some of the others. Peres harumphed and said, “Number the jars
then and mind you write legibly.” “Yes Instructor.”</p>
<p>He brought the lightest colored berries with him as she walked down
the halls, matching his pace. They tinkled in the jar with each step. He
grabbed his dark brown robe that showed his seniority, Syntyche’s was
the green that showed she had just become an alchemist. Not new by any
means, no longer needed to practice under a master but didn’t chafe at
still being called a child. Peres knew better but didn’t care, she had
been his apprentice and would be a child to him until he died.</p>
<p>He could feel the cold of the stone floors through his slippers, the
cold trying to get through the walls. It was more a tomb than a home,
but it had been home for so long and would continue to be during and
after his life.</p>
<p>“Peres, nice of you to join us,” Jachin said as he walked through,
“though you dawddled.” “I do not run to summons,” he felt like an old
bear with cubs around him, “why was I summoned?” “We needed a quorom.”
“There were enough before me.” “Not for this,” Jachin said, “will you
change your mind about joining the guilds?” “Why have you brought me
down for this? My mind will never change on this, it is blasphemy. It is
foolish” Peres said and looked around, “has he persuaded any of you?”
For the first time Peres realized he didn’t recognize almost any of the
Chamber. He didn’t know any of them. And then he noticed tears were in
Syntyche’s eyes.</p>
<p>“All in favor of rescinding Instructor Peres’s status in the
Chamber.”</p>
<p>Only three of the two dozen abstained and they did not support his
keeping his position.</p>
<p>“As you said, you would never change your mind. Your position of
instructor is not revoked, you are still the best research–”</p>
<p>He spoke slowly and quietly, but his voice carried, “Child, you have
gone too far. If you think that my obstinancy is for some reason of
pride you are mistaken. If the guilds join, you will plunge us into
darkness. Light and darkness cannot bear one another. I will have no
part of this.”</p>
<p>“You have no choice,” Jachin said.</p>
<p>Peres took three deep breaths, it was one thing to consider jumping a
cliff and another to step off the ledge.</p>
<p>“I do,” he took off his ring that signified his membership in the
guild and dropped it, and then removed his cloak and dropped that on top
and turned on his heel to walk.</p>
<p>“Peres,” said behind his back, but then someone else said “just leave
it.” And he left the way he had come.</p>
