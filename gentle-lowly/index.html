<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The main point of Gentle and Lowly by Dane Ortlund is that Christ’s
heart is gentle and
lowly<label for="mn-surprise" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-surprise" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">surprise, given the title</span>, that is primarily
who Christ is. It is the spring that all other attributes of Christ flow
from.</p>
<p>This is something that American Christians get wrong. When we see the
wrath of God and we think it comes from a holiness of
heart,<label for="mn-holy" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-holy" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">and God is holy</span> we must ask what is wrath?
What is anger for? Why would someone flip tables?</p>
<p>Primarily for protection.</p>
<p>My toddler daughter was almost run over by someone biking. Even
though I am tender towards her largely, that’s where most of my actions
come from, when I believed she was going to be harmed, I seemed angry.
And that is good.</p>
<p>If God is the tender, gentle, lover of my soul then how does wrath
fit in? How does Jealousy? How does holiness? It is out of a desire for
the beloved<label for="mn-beloved" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-beloved" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">me, you, the Church</span> not in an objectifying
way<label for="mn-genesis" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-genesis" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">Genesis 5</span>, dehumanizing way, but in a “for us
not against us” kind of way.</p>
<p>So all of these attributes flow from the gentle and lowly
humility.</p>
<p>Humility that would talk to the woman at the well. Humility that
would let the woman wash his feet with her tears. That would say “let
the one without sin throw the first stone.” That would draw the children
to himself and rebuke his disciples for preventing them.</p>
<p>Humility that would look at the rich young ruler or crowds of
thousands and have compassion. That would weep with Lazarus’ sisters at
his death.</p>
<p>Humility that would look at Jerusalem and cry. That would have him
wash his disciples’ feet, even Judas’s. That would have Christ give up
his life in a completely debasing way. That would invite the thief to
paradise. That would care for his mother while dying. That would pray
the psalms while dying and with his last breath forgive his
murderers.</p>

<h2>Response</h2>
<p>So then, how should we live? Similarly, gentle and lowly. The wrath
of man does not produce the righteousness of God. Do you want to know
who Jesus flips tables at? It’s not the liberals. It is not people who
are “ruining this country,” it isn’t the foreigner or immigrant. It is
people who take his name in vain, not people who use God’s name as a
swear word. People who claim to be Christians but don’t care for the
poor. Who justify means by the
end<label for="mn-hint" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-hint" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">hint: the ends <em>never</em> justify the
means</span>. Who don’t love the widows and orphans. Who trample other
image bearers. It’s people who insist on protecting themselves instead
of sacrificing the way Christ did.</p>
<p>Is there room for anger and rage? Hell yeah there is, but not because
the republicans or democrats got an election they shouldn’t have. Your
enemies aren’t political, your enemies are agents of satan and they are
spiritual. Gird your loins, take the correction. I am preaching to
myself.</p>

<section id="questions" class="level2">
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>Should we be as gentle and lowly as Christ, is there such a thing as
too gentle and lowly? Paul seems combative in his letters, how do we
make sure that our hearts are gentle and lowly as Christ’s? Can you
change your heart if it isn’t gentle and lowly? How does one have a
change of heart?</p>
