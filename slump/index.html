        <h1>How to Get Into a Slump</h1>
        <section>
            <p>An exercise in the same vein as this <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0197SJPCE">book</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o">video</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of people have recently been asking “Daniel, how can I get into
a slump or rut?, or”Daniel, I want to be depressed but I don’t know
how.” I point out that their second comment wasn’t actually a question
and they thank me for pointing it out.</p>
<p>In any case, I wanted to be able to point to a specific essay so that
I can earn ad revenue. In my years of experience, I’ve found the
following tips to be helpful.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get into a poor sleep “schedule.”</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I say “schedule,” the idea is that you would be as erratic as
possible in your sleeping and waking times. Spend as much time as
possible either watching TV (youtube, netflix, disney+) or scrolling
facebook or twitter on your phone, and then turn the light out. Ideally
as short of content as possible.</p>
<p>Even better, turn the light out and then scroll. You should have some
kind of after image in your vision, if you don’t, try again.</p>
<p>As you fall asleep, ruminate on your failures. Avoid thinking about
how you might do better in the future, but think only of how it will be
impossible to repair the damage you have done to those you love.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Eat poorly.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Opposite of how you sleep, this should be very consistent. Focus on
sugar, bread, red meat, and a stimulant, whether that be caffeine
(energy drinks late in the day ideally) or nicotine (patches,
cigarettes, chew etc.). In addition, eat late at night right before you
go to bed. If you time it correctly and eat enough, you’ll exacerbate
what you started in Step #1. If you do this perfectly, you’ll give
yourself acid reflux and eventually throat cancer.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Don’t move.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that many people don’t know is that regularly exercising
makes it difficult to get poor sleep. Of the different habits to start,
this is also one of the easiest to get started, even on accident and if
you aren’t careful, other habits may follow. When you’re physically
exhausted it is easier to believe that wasting your time isn’t a bad
thing.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Don’t spend time with people.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>People are going to steer you off your desired path. Spending time
with them releases endorphins and will remind you of goals other than
being in a slump. They’ll sing to you the siren song of deep
relationships and considering how your actions might affect others and
not just yourself. Think of bending in on yourself, that is how you want
to approach life.</p>
<p>A simple way to drive people away is to turn every conversation piece
to how you relate and then bemoan the fact that you have no friends.
After you drive people away, actively pursue them with no other care
than not being alone (see how that’s bent on you?) with no care any
actual activity.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Listen to the voice in the back of your head.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the voice that tells you to put things off and condemns you
when you do. The same voice that suggests one more episode on netflix.
One more scoop of ice cream. Yes you can skip this workout. Ignore his
text, get to it later. It’s easier to always pick lunch up than pack it.
Don’t worry about saving, tomorrow will worry about itself. One more
drink. Keep scrolling. Always more. It doesn’t matter if that person is
being degraded, watch. Be entertained.</p>
<p>So now you have a good idea of how to get into and stay in a slump.
If you find yourself gaining traction in an area of your life, come back
to this list to correct it. If you’ve never really found yourself in a
slump or feeling like you’re in a rut, then try any or all of these
tips.</p>
