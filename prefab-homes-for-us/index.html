        <h1>Prefab Homes for Us?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>In Sweden 85% of new single family homes and 40% of multifamily homes
are partially or completely built in a factory, compared to the US at
roughly half that.</p>
<p>Brian Potter wrote a <a
href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/should-us-homebuilders-emulate-sweden">thoughtful
essay</a> about prefab homes, it is well worth a read. Why doesn’t the
US have more prefab homes? The gist of it is the cost of Swedish homes
are 70% more than US homes and they aren’t any faster at building them.
When building anything in the US, speed is one of the most important
factors. There are a variety of reasons that prefab homes are still a
good idea for the Swedes (i.e. reducing time on site, quality control)
but he buries the lead.</p>
<p>The cost of building multi family homes was roughly flat from
2017-2023 in Sweden (or decreasing, if you convert it to USD). Even if
this isn’t entirely because of prefabrication, it’s a strong hint that
construction companies in the US should look to for ideas.</p>
