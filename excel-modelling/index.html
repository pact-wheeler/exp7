        <h1>Standards for Excel Modeling</h1>
        <section>
            <section id="overall" class="level2">
<h2>Overall</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Excel models should be flexible, appropriate, structured, and
transparent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is cribbed from the FAST Standards found <a
href="https://www.fast-standard.org/">here</a> without permission.</p>
<p>Any Excel modeler should be able to audit and explain what the
workbook is calculating relatively quickly. With the pace and quantity
of projects required for excel modelers, having standards increases
efficiency and accuracy while modeling solutions. <strong>It will slow
you down to start.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each worksheet is a chapter in the novel of your excel model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four groups of sheets within each excel model: foundation,
working sheets, checks, and presentations.</p>
<p>The <strong>foundation</strong> consists of inputs and instructions,
raw data, and organized raw data. Input and instruction sheets provide a
description of the model’s flow, notes about colors, jargon or terms,
and functions used in the model. As part of the instructions write out
the model’s weaknesses, and assumptions. You can include within the
input/instructions or separately, but either way, provide a table of
contents.</p>
<p>Include a dedicated comment column on input sheets. Either you will
move onto another project and forget about each of the decisions you
made or the model will be handed off. Having the context that
information provides will be invaluable to the tool’s longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Working sheets</strong> include multiple calculation sheets,
named appropriately given their purpose. Be rigorous about labelling
each column as they’re created. Review the logic constantly, leave
temporary code as short as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Check sheets</strong> verify that your calculation blocks
aren’t excluding the data or counting any of it twice. Look for multiple
ways to come to the same result for the final and intermediate
calculations. At the very least, ensure that the sum is the same at the
before and after your transformations.</p>
<p>At the top of each sheet within the model (with the possible
exclusion of the report/presentation page) have the outputs of check
sheets in a freeze pane.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation sheets</strong> summarize the final output of
the calculation block. As often as not, it will just equal the range
that the final output exists in with some formatting. When it makes
sense include definitions of the units.</p>
<p>A model must completely explain how it works without the need for
other software applications to present the model outputs. If you need a
chart or graph, include that in the presentation sheet. Don’t use excel
defaults, it shows laziness. Instead create default formats for yourself
and stick to those few charts, do not chase all the new functions and
tools that Microsoft create, choose expertise in fewer tools. People err
on the side of too complicated rather than too simple. A data table is
incredibly informationally dense, your readers are smarter than you
think. If you don’t know how to present data, refer to Stephen Few’s
show me the numbers.</p>
<p>To reduce size and increase speed of the excel model use structured
references and tables instead of range references when possible. Avoid
volatile functions (CELL, INDIRECT, INFO, NOW, OFFSET, RAND, RANDARRAY,
RANDBETWEEN, ROW, COLUMN, TODAY). For large datasets, prefer
SUMIFS/COUNTIFS over multiple calculation blocks. Avoid nested formulas
in almost all cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="general-workbook-design-principles" class="level2">
<h2>General Workbook Design Principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your excel model is a novel, it tells a specific story, accomplishes
a particular result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use only one time ruler throughout the model if possible and freeze a
column or row with it. Except in the report page, juxtapose secondary
and primary time rulers. Never daisy chain links. Links should always go
directly to the user input, or calculation throughout the book.</p>
<p>Use in-flow / out-flow convention on all sheets. Revenues should be
positive, expenses are negative. Arrange sheets and calculations so that
calculation order flows from left to right except to group Input and
Results sheets, typically at the beginning.</p>
<p>Do not optimize workings and presentation in the same worksheet. You
get the worst of both worlds when you do this and updating becomes
difficult. Flags are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">Boolean</a> values
that determine whether a period of item counts for that calculation.
Factors are any user inputs or constants that affect the calculation.
Separate them, ideally into different sheets, if not, then into
different blocks, and at the very least into different columns or
rows.</p>
<p>Each working sheet should be contained with the end result on the far
left or bottom of the data. Sheets should not be inter-linked overly
much and should be marked. A single model should not be multiple
workbooks with a few exceptions; when a data source gets updated
regularly and that can easily dropped in a folder, and when multiple
folks are working on a model.</p>
<p>Power Query is the default to pull in data from other files/folders.
This helps reduce errors because the resulting table can then be
referenced. For sheets and tables that are pulled from external sources,
separate them from any working sheets. I typically mark them as “Raw” in
the sheetname, even if the query does manipulate them.</p>
</section>
<section id="calculation-blocks" class="level2">
<h2>Calculation Blocks</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a paragraph in the novel of your excel model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calculation blocks follow this pattern: ingredients, flags,
calculations, and result. Except when there are cascading calculation
blocks where you’ll have multiple calculation steps. This is better than
long formulas for ease of debugging and explaining the model to others.
Corkscrew calculation blocks are another exception, where the ending
balance of one period is the beginning balance of another.</p>
<p>Series worksheets should be defined for a single time axis only.
<strong>What is a series?</strong></p>
<p>Make only two columns matter for each calculation block, by that I
mean you should only have to check the constants and the calculation
column. All other columns (or rows) should follow exactly the same
formula. That’s <em>part</em> of why each column should only contain one
calculation or constant. (Credit: Mike Girvin), document formulas using
the FORMULATEXT function, that way you can confirm multiple calculations
without going into each one. This also will be benefited by shorter
formulas and breaking calculations up.</p>
<p>Calculation logic should flow from top to bottom and left to right.
Only use counter-flows opening balance positions, as the first
ingredient within a calculation block.</p>
<p>Do not hide anything unless it will be empty or always zero. You
might have these if you have a time series that forces you to include a
timeline that will always have zero values. This will be the
exception.</p>
<p>Construct calculations in a separate calculation blocks except when
the calculation block is a balance corkscrew or it is trivial. Sometimes
you’ll have a 2D calculation block, especially when dividing things by
the same time series but over categories or you’re summarizing by
multiple criteria (viz. cost type and business line).</p>
<p>If you find yourself rebuilding similar calculation blocks save them
for reuse. Order your calculation blocks in their order of importance.
Each calculation sheets should follow a similar ordering.</p>
<p>List common calculation block components in a consistent order. List
precedents in the order they appear in a formula. As a rule, use
corkscrew calculation blocks for balance accumulation, keep the formulas
short and use the sheet itself to do the calculation.</p>
<p>Timing and factor flags are conditions that control whether certain
conditions exist, use these outside of an IF formula (or nested IFs,
<strong>may it never be so</strong>) so that you can easily see why
you’re getting a certain result from your IF function</p>
<p>Place display totals on the left or top within frozen frames where
they are always visible.</p>
<p>Within your whole model, choose a capitalization convention and stick
with it. If you don’t what to select, choose sentence case, it’s the
superior choice.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-line-item" class="level2">
<h2>The Line Item</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the sentence in the novel of your excel model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Provide a <strong>good, unique</strong> label for all line items,
include a units designator (balance, cash or otherwise). Maintain
labelling consistency pedantically and precisely. Label each row, each
column, how it is calculated, if it’s an opening or closing balance.
Have default headers and sub-headers throughout your model. The way that
I’ve done this is by having a macro sheet that I keep open most of the
time with the formatting I use (more detail under the heading of
<em>Format Rules</em>).</p>
<p>Do not use a series structure to present constant, i.e. do not repeat
a constant, constantly on a line within a calculation block. It clutters
the workspace and introduces more opportunity for error.</p>
<p>Do not use subtotals of rows or columns in model logic except at the
end of a calculation block.</p>
<p>Make numbers look like what they are with thoughtful formats.</p>
<p>Formulas within columns must be consistent except when marked as
temporary code; mark temporary code clearly with a yellow background.
Examples of temporary code are</p>
<p>Do not use partial range references, I can’t think of a use case to
do this intentionally except as a very temporary code, which would be
marked as such.</p>
<p>Reduce the number of functions that you use within excel and shorten
your formulas, leverage the worksheet itself to do the work. No formula
should take more than 30 seconds to explain what it’s goal is and how it
does it. If it does, ask yourself if there’s a way to break it apart.
[If you, like me, have become accustomed to writing more and more
complex formulas, then this will require a big shift in your thinking.
It’s incredible what Excel can compute within a single cell, but just
because we can, doesn’t mean we should and I can’t overemphasize the
benefit of fast formula fixing after the excel model is regularly being
used by others.]</p>
<p>To determine whether a time period would calculate or not, use
relevant flags when they’re needed. Include display totals on all flags
to easily determine how often that particular condition is filtering
rows/columns out.</p>
</section>
<section id="formula-rules" class="level2">
<h2>Formula Rules</h2>
<p>Use flags to limit use of IF function. Flags are columns or rows that
determine if a condition is met, usually timing but could be categories
or thresholds. Use Excel names sparingly, they work best for data
validation lists, user input, and constants.</p>
<p>Be as clear as possible with what is happening within a formula. Do
not use a space as a substitute for multiplication, it isn’t clear what
is happening and can be confusing. You can and sometimes should includes
spaces between arguments in formulas as a formatting tool. Do not embed
constants except for sign switches, with should be done with a “-1*” at
the beginning of the formula. All other constants should refer to one of
the foundation pages. Parentheses should be used for necessity and
improving formula clarity (and that rarely). If you refer to another
sheet while writing a formula, Excel will then include the sheet
reference that the formula exists on, you should delete this.</p>
<p>Beware circularity or #ERRORs protected on inactive branch of IF
function, breaking apart IFs into multiple columns helps prevent
this.</p>
<p>Do not use a complete absolute reference when you only need to use an
anchored column or row.</p>
</section>
<section id="excel-features-used-in-modelling" class="level2">
<h2>Excel Features Used in Modelling</h2>
<p>Use the INDEX function over the CHOOSE function and generally, choose
excel functions that allow for flexibilty unless you’re writing
temporary code.</p>
<p>Do not use the NPV function, it’s broken and will not get you the
result you want, or may get you the result you want but not in all
cases. XNPV calculates correctly, but if you want to see exactly what’s
happening, break it out into a calculation block.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully use ROUND when needed, not at every step. You should
only need to use ROUND at the end of a calculation sheet or when
multiplying proportions against totals. Rarely, you will need to round
intermediately to match another software.</p>
</section>
<section id="format-rules" class="level2">
<h2>Format Rules</h2>
<p>Here are the rules I follow for consistency and pedantry: mark
exports with red font, imports with blue font, counter-flows with gray
shade, user inputs with light yellow font. Consistently apply header and
sub header column formatting. Include at least one empty column or row
between calculation blocks. Do not merge cells, use Center across
selections.</p>
