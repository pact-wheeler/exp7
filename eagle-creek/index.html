        <h1>Water Fall</h1>
        <section>
            <p>A few days ago, we went on a second trip on the Eagle Creek Trail.
This time it was lower miles, about fifteen in all. Our plan was to hike
to a campsite most of the way to Inspiration Point and use it as a base
camp. It was supposed to be relaxed. We had only planned on chilling,
playing cards and unwinding a bit before the new semester started at
school.</p>
<p>Although we left my house a bit later than we intended, it was fine
because of the low mileage. The drive felt early but no problems in
transit. As we pulled into the parking lot, three people were headed off
of the trail. One of them looked like a sage backpacker; we asked him
why he was heading off the trail so early.</p>
<p>“About three fourths of a mile up is a really nasty ice patch.” “How
bad?” David asked. “Icicles the size of a man hanging over the path and
the path itself is slicker than snot.” “We’ll check it out.” David
replied.</p>
<p>The other two had a similar story. Apprehension welled up in the pit
of my stomach as I strapped my backpack in.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this!” David said as I locked my car. His enthusiasm was
contagious and soon we were off. The scenery was breathtaking, ice
formed at the edge of every body of water. On the opposite side of the
creek (we passed on the left going up the trail) were sheets of glass
hanging from trees and the creek had ice all around it, though the creek
itself was intensely blue and clear. After a quarter of an hour we
passed the first of three ice patches, it was not nearly as bad as I
thought it would be.</p>
<p>“Just keep your weight over your feet.” David said.</p>
<p>Though it was slick, there was hardly any incline. Even with the
river rushing by me, I passed it shortly.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t so bad,” I said to him. “Not at all.” He replied.</p>
<p>Along the trail were these odd fibrous ice growths. They looked like
ice plants, often with pine needles and other detritus on top. After
touching a few, their fragility was obvious. The next three miles passed
without incident, except that David pointed out many rock and ice
formations and trees besides. I listened, enjoying the view and
friendship.</p>
<p>Eventually we came to Tunnel Falls, foreshadowed by a dull roar a few
hundred feet down the trail. As we neared it, a winter wonderland
greeted us. Everything was covered in ice. Off of every precipice
icicles hung. Ice and snow blanketed the whole area. It was
spectacular.</p>
<p>“Press on and press forth,” David said.</p>
<p>So we did.</p>
<p>As icy and bad as it was, there was a half-inch cable running along
the worst of it, at points we held on for dear life. This was the second
of three dire spots that day.</p>
<p>Less than half a mile later we came across the final ice patch on our
trail. Only twenty feet of slope separated me from a roaring river and
waterfall below. With the ice four inches thick and nothing to hold onto
I stopped.</p>
<p>“David,” I said, looking desperate, “I have never seen anything more
dangerous in my life.” “It’ll be fine, I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>He gave me no choice but to follow shortly after.</p>
<p>As I was walking, I took one wrong step. The ice was just too
slippery. I cried out for God, “Lord help!” I stopped slipping and made
it to a safe spot ahead.</p>
<p>David was twenty feet ahead of me and didn’t notice. I was
continually in prayer until we were out of the ice patch completely.
After getting into camp the first thing we did was pump water, not
wanting to be anywhere near the water in the dark. David set up the tent
while I worked on a fire. After three tries, I realized my inadequacy
and what kind of predicament we were in. I tried jumping up and down for
a little bit to un-numb my feet.</p>
<p>I shoved my hands in my pockets and walked over to David, “The wood
is too wet. I can’t get a fire going.” Without looking up from his work
he said, “I see that.”</p>
<p>I choked down dinner (I was dehydrated and nauseous) we climbed into
the tent. I wasn’t sure of my sleeping bag but it was warm in a matter
of minutes. We talked for a bit and fell into fits of rest and
sleep.</p>
<p>That night, I spoke to the Lord.</p>
<p>“Lord I don’t want to die.” I had been planning on continuing but a
whisper in my heart interrupted me.</p>
<p>“You will live, but watch out for David.”</p>
<p>I immediately started praying for David’s life.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The sunlight on the ceiling of the tent woke me up. I reached for my
water bottle outside of the tent, it was frozen completely solid, as
were David’s. As David and I talked through the day to come, I explained
what happened on the ice. There were two options, we could go up and
around by Wattum Lake (which was a lot more mileage and we had no idea
what lay that way) or we could go below Tunnel Falls and then hike out
Wednesday. We later found out that freezing rain was supposed to start
that evening, and would make the hike down horribly dangerous, covering
everything in half inch thick ice.</p>
<p>We tried the Wattum Lake trail but only 50 feet up the trail was an
impassable spot, we soon returned to camp and headed the other
direction. Because we camped so close to the worst ice spot, it wasn’t
even half an hour before we were at it. The only word to describe it was
treacherous. It had warmed up enough that all the ice had a thin sheet
of water covering it. Constantly I prayed, thanking God for each—</p>
<p>“Daniel!” I heard David shout.</p>
<p>I turned around to see him less than an arm’s length away from the
waterfall. A wet sheet of ice separated us.</p>
<p>“Are you okay!?” I shouted.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He said, looking around at his feet, picking up a hiking pole
just above him.</p>
<p>The roar of the waterfall made it difficult to talk but I motioned
him to a tree about fifty feet upstream of him. The only reason he could
even walk was because the moving water cut at the ice and the rock
beneath him wasn’t completely smooth. The stretch of path that had taken
me so long before only seemed to take seconds. After he made it to the
tree there was a patch of snow that afforded some grip. I unbuckled my
thirty pound pack and threw it on the ground. My water bottle flew out
of its pocket and into the river.</p>
<p>“Should I give you my pack first?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I laid down and hoisted the pack up, laying it next to mine. After
doing setting his hiking poles next to mine I reached for his hand,
“Your turn.”</p>
<p>“I can’t get a good foot hold,” he said, looking at the ground.
“That’s what my hand is for. I am <em>going</em> to pull you out. You
can scramble up if you need to.” “Okay.” He grabbed onto my hand and he
climbed out.</p>
<p>“You’re okay?” I asked. “A little banged up. I’m kinda shaky.”</p>
<p>We both rested, catching our breath. I cannot even imagine what it
would have been like to have to go over the same ice patch again. The
only thing I knew to do was to pray.</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I prayed for us?” “Not at all.” I closed my eyes,
“Lord, we know you are a good God. We are your servants always. God
please give us sure footing, guide us in every step we take.”</p>
<p>That phrase meant more in that second than it ever had before.</p>
<p>Once again I faced my icy hell, now even less sure of myself than I
had been the first time. I prayed constantly for David’s and mine
safety. My conversation with the Lord from the night before echoed in my
consciousness. After the worst of it we shuffled down the icy path,
using our hiking poles for everything we could.</p>
<p>As we looked at the waterfall, thousands of gallons of water spilled
over each second. Icicles the size of men hugged the walls of the
ravine.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you’re alive man.” I said to him. “You and me both…you
and me both.”</p>
<p>There was nothing left but to continue on down the path.</p>
<p>So we did.</p>
<p>It was amazing that the day before everything had been as nonchalant
as it had. The beauty all lay there in the landscape but it was a
terrible beauty, a fierce beauty and a reckless one. Later down the
trail we saw a man come up. He was only up for the day, even as we
expressed our concern he continued up the trail, leaving us.</p>
<p>Most of the time, in the really bad spots there was something to hold
onto, whether it was icicles or rocks. However, I saw a patch up ahead
longer than five feet that sloped towards the water twenty feet below.
Since he had fallen last time, I had David in front of me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even David’s fault. It was one step that had no grip. He
clawed wildly, digging his poles into the ice.</p>
<p>“NO! DAVID! NO!” I shouted, tearing at my vocal chords, but that was
all I could do.</p>
<p>In mid fall he twisted around onto his back, he fell into waist deep
water, just behind a leafless tree.</p>
<p>“David!” I shouted, after he landed.</p>
<p>“I’m okay! I’m okay! I’m okay!” He shouted, in shock.</p>
<p>Up the river from him was a large sand bar, if he’d fallen even a few
feet down river he would have been underwater completely.</p>
<p>“David! Head up and over, I’ll be able to climb down to you!”
“What!?” He shouted. I repeated myself as loud as I could, motioning
wildly with my arms. Regardless of whether he heard me he headed up
stream on the sand bar. I soon found a place to climb down. I unbuckled
my pack, adrenaline making my movements shaky.</p>
<p>As I reached the bottom I once again asked, “Are you okay?” “I’m
pretty banged up but no broken bones.” “I’ll grab your pack and carry it
up.” “That’d be good.” He grimaced, rotating his arm.</p>
<p>On the trail, as we put our packs on, I prayed. “Lord, you have
control of everything. We can’t do this without you. Lord we love you
and submit everything, even our very lives to you. Amen.”</p>
<p>As we steeled ourselves to cross over the area that David had just
fallen on, the man we’d seen before came down the trail. We explained
the situation and introduced ourselves.</p>
<p>“There’s no going back up.” Adam said. “Let’s go on.” I said.</p>
<p>I stepped very carefully forward. I could not have been more
intentional to keep my weight directly over my feet.</p>
<p>“Lord please,” was my whole prayer.</p>
<p>As I made it to the part where David had slipped last I started to
lose grip. My feet started moving towards the edge.</p>
<p>My whole being screamed, “I want to live!”</p>
<p>I threw my body forward and skidded to a stop on my knees. I looked
up to see David and Adam looking concerned. “I’m okay.” I reassured them
as much as myself. I watched as they both crossed, constantly
praying.</p>
<p>“Do you remember if that’s the last of it?” I asked Adam. “There’s
one more.”</p>
<p>Although the next spot was bad, it was more because icicles hung over
our heads. One missed Adam’s head by inches and smashed his boot, or
would have if they hadn’t been steel toed. We found out later he had
been mountaineering quite a bit and was very experienced. Although most
of the mileage was ahead of us, the worst was behind. One of the most
blessed things I have ever seen was that parking lot coming into
view.</p>
<p>We shook hands with Adam when we parted ways.</p>
<p>As we walked to our car there was a gal sitting on the tailgate of a
rig. “Good job on not falling to your icy death.” She said, laughing as
she breathed out cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>I couldn’t say anything in response but only looked at David.</p>
