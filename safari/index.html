            <p>Sales Safari</p>
<p>Take a piece of paper, or open a new document in your favorite
note-taking app. Do not optimize this process. Do not have an LLM do it
for you, you prompt an LLM to critique your finished work.</p>
<p>Write the following headings or break your page into the following
headings:</p>
<p>Rough notes - anything important that doesn’t fit into the following
headings. Pains - List all the pains that folks imply or talk about in
the sales call or forum thread Worldview - This is one of the trickiest
elements of Sales Safari, but also one of the most important, how do
these people approach the world. Just try your best, have someone
critique you, have an LLM critique you. Jargon - Any word or phrase used
specific to an industry Recommendations - When people talk about pains,
they tend to also talk about solutions</p>
<p>After going through the forum or sales call with what you’ve learned
going under these headings, save it in a folder and reference it when
considering your product. Ask yourself thoughtful questions. Write
emails and copy that directly addresses these pains. If it’s a forum,
have an LLM compare your analysis with the text, see if it comes up with
anything more. If it’s a sales call, use Vibe to create a transcript and
do the same thing.</p>
<p>How do you find a forum if you don’t have sales calls to reference?
Using a search engine, google forums related to your topic. If you have
direct competitors, go to their website to see if they have a forum,
people love to complain. It could be an amazon product review page. Use
your imagination.</p>
<p>The customer does not care about your writing, or about your product.
A customer does not buy your product because they like your product. A
customer buys your product because they believe it will turn them into a
more awesome version of themselves.</p>
