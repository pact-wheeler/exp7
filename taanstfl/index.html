        <h1>No Free Lunch</h1>
        <section>
            <blockquote>
<p>“Oh, <em>Tanstaafl</em> means there ain’t no such thing as a free
lunch. And isn’t,” I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room,”
or these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything
free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless.” ― Robert
A. Heinlein, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have more paid apps on my phone than anyone else I know. If I’m not
paying for something I’m using, either someone is doing me a favor or
I’m the product. When I don’t understand how something is profitable,
I’m wary of using it.</p>

<p>I’ve recently switched to <a
href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, a paid email service. And
you’re reading this on a website that is included in the cost to have my
own email + the $12 a year that it costs from to register it at <a
href="https://www.bookmyname.com/">BookMyName</a>, but I wouldn’t
recommend them despite the price. Including the email service it works
about to about $72/yr and the main competitor to this is Squarespace
which is ~$192 a year. And that’s the cheapest option, for businesses
it’s another $5/mo to be able to use all of their features, and another
$10/mo to use their mail. No wonder they advertise on every single
podcast.</p>
<p>But back to my phone, my apps are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://timeryapp.com/">Timery</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yomu-reader.com/">Yomu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the apps on my phone are a mix of services that allow me
to pay the company (payment model is obvious there) or open sourced.</p>
<p>As I was writing this I just realized I <u>never</u> see (I do hear
them when listening to podcasts) any ads on my phone unless I’m on
Safari which is <a
href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1727/1727-h/1727-h.htm#chap12">rare</a>,
as it is disabled almost all of the time.</p>
<p>Switching away from Google can be difficult, but <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google">Google’s
list of privacy concerns</a> is long and obvious when you look at <a
href="https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/">incentives</a>.
They make more money when they are better able to advertise to you. The
same is true with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a
href="https://about.meta.com/">Meta</a>, &amp; <a
href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">X</a>, you might think of them as a
search engine, a store, or social media; they are the same way that a
ranch farmer is a day care for cows.</p>
<p>Do they offer services to the cows? Absolutely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rest assured, my love for you and your love for me are as like as two
peas. I have always desired you, as you (pitiful fool) desired me. The
difference is that I am the stronger. I think they will give you to me
now; or a bit of you. Love you? Why, yes. As dainty a morsel as ever I
grew fat on.</p>
<p>― CS Lewis, The Screwtape Letters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do they care for the cows? It depends on what you mean when you ask
that question. They care for the cows the way a diner wants their steak
to be of high quality, not the way a friend cares for your well
being.</p>
<p>As I navigate the digital world, I try to be highly aware of who gets
the money, because every dollar is a vote.</p>
<p>Work with companies you want to work with.</p>
