        <h1>In Reference to your Recent Communication</h1>
        <section>

<h2>intro</h2>
<p>Dearest Jessica,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding your desperate letter I received last
Thursday. Although I understand there were forces acting upon you, your
message sounded thought out. Clearly, it has not altered your ability to
write, nor has it taken any vitriol from your sarcasm.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss your letter in detail, assuming that you have
the mental capacity and attention span for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 1: Introduction</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume, of course, that you have all of our previous communications
for reference, including, not limited to, letters, electronic mail,
phone messages, and transcripts of conversations crucial to the progress
of our relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know what happens when you assume, Jessica? And no, there is
no way that I have all of the transcripts of our conversations. Only a
psychopath bent on torturing someone who cares for her would do
something remotely resembling that.</p>
</section>
<section id="middle" class="level2">
<h2>middle</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>First message: When I tried to politely break-up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was unsure how to proceed, I cared deeply for you
<label for="mn-past-tense" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-past-tense" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">Do you notice the past tense? If you didn’t you
ought</span>. I wanted the best for you but I didn’t know how to tell
you that it didn’t involve me. My motives? My motives might have been
influenced by friends and family but probably also my therapist. And no,
your and my feelings are not the only ones that matter in this
relationship. I not an island. I am connected to my friends and family
and while, perhaps, I should distance myself from them. You, nor anyone
else, can complete me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First message: Disadvantages</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will not disagree with the aforementioned advantages. I will
however inform you on some of the negative consequences of our
relationship. I have become so stressed out that I am no longer hungry.
Especially not tofu. A man cannot eat just salad and toppings and call
it dinner. Do you know what I have been having at Jay’s? I have had
bacon for breakfast, pork loin for lunch, and steak for dinner. Even
though I have not been here a month I have gained most of my weight
back, thank god.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First message: Dismissal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way that I was not sure how to start this conversation,
neither was I certain how to end it. Do you think my
performance<label for="mn-performer" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-performer" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">Is that all I am to you? A performer. You aren’t the
person I thought you were. Someone else might say that you weren’t the
person I moved in with but it has become more and more obvious who you
were.</span> was at least partly related to how I felt? If you were so
interested in a healthy relationship and I was obviously distancing
myself from you<label for="mn-headaches" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-headaches" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">no one has headaches that often</span>, then why
didn’t we openly talk? Ask yourself that, Jess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second message: Rejection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. If I say things are going badly, then they are. If you say things
are going badly, then they are. Only one has to defect. For you to
decide that things are going well means that you are deluding yourself,
which I knew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second message: “Feelings”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The healthy growth of our relationship? No. Healthy growth of our
relationship would involve more communication, not subjection of one
individual by another. Any “issues” I have, I will discuss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second message: Guinea Pigs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn’t in the room, you weren’t there. I was taking a dump. Did you
forget who took Tootsie II to the vet right away? But given what’s
happened since, I would watch in “horror” as the dog mauled Tootsie II.
In fact, I would encourage Boxer. And then, to spite you, I would buy
another guinea for him to play with, just to see what would happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third message: The worst mistake of my life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was continuing to date you. I am so happy now that I have rectified
it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third message: Um</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think it is possible that you’re reading too much into my
“ums?” Is it possible that it is just a filler word? And it was Jay’s
cousin’s cell number. I just forgot to mention that Jay’s cousin was a
delightful server at that casino and is the one that got us in to the
VIP backroom where I met Morgan Freeman and Harrison Ford. They give
their condolences. The server’s name is Jasmine.</p>

<section id="concluding-remarks" class="level2">
<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
<p>I did notice that all of our joint bank accounts are frozen, but did
you notice most of the money had been transferred out in the last
several months? This was not an overnight decision. I am a little upset
about the cell phone but I understand.</p>
<p>I understand all too well.</p>
<p>Jay was not jailed; I knew that Leslie was your friend and the baked
goods she was giving him were laced. I advised him to not partake. All
is laid bare. I know you better than you know yourself.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, there were some happy moments, but the sum of
them don’t keep me from seeing you for who you really are. You are so
small that the only way to feel big is to stand on another’s back.</p>
<p>My hope is that in five years I’ll see you at a coffee shop or
outside restaurant as I’m walking by in this big city and that you’ll be
showing your husband, partner, or child something in a book and then
I’ll know that you made it through this time and ended up alright on the
other side.</p>
<p>I wish you the best in all your future
endeavors<label for="mn-separate" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-separate" class="margin-toggle"/> <span
class="marginnote">separate from me</span>.</p>
<p>Good-bye, Randolph</p>
<p>P.S. Attached you will find a restraining order, I feel that this is
best for you given your propensity to hold on tightly to things being
taken from you.</p>
