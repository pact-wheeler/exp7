    <li>
        <p>Learning path - </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I&#39;m no longer using spaced repetition with Anki, what I&#39;ve found that seems to be bearing
                more fruit is making connections between the different places I&#39;ve learned. I read the book, <a
                    href='https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes'target="_blank">How to Take Smart Notes</a> and have started
                implementing a slip-box (zettelkasten). </li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Writing articles using Typora and publishing them on github (where you're now reading) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Instead of learning vega-lite and power bi I&#39;m leaning more heavily into Excel and Power Query (do what
            you know?)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I have been learning a lot about process control charts and have made some alterations to xmrit's version. It works very well but the presentation is just not up to my standards.</p>
        <p>I'm working with a few clients using this process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Slowly switching to open source software and <a href='https://sive.rs/ti'target="_blank">tech independence</a></p>
    </li>

</ul>
