What's a [now page](https://sive.rs/now3)? 

1. Learning path 
I'm no longer relying so heavily on spaced repetition, what I've found that seems to be bearing more fruit is making connections between the different places I've learned. I read the book, [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) and have started implementing a slip-box (zettelkasten)

2. Instead of learning vega-lite and power bi I'm leaning more heavily into Excel and Power Query (do what you know?)
3. Slowly switching to open source software and [tech independence](https://sive.rs/ti)
