        <h1>Umwelt</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Umwelt is a German word (no people has better words or engineering)
that means roughly “sensed environment.” I’d like to take this idea a
little forward, umwelt was first conceived in the world of biology. It
includes the idea of threats and resources but largely refers to what a
creature can sense in a physical domain. In the wikipedia article about
it it also refers to what resources and threats a creature can “see”
based on their experience.</p>
<p>You and I can grow up in the same house, go to the same schools, have
the same parents, but if you and I see the world differently then we
have a different umwelt. You never knew what it was to have an older
sister, or friends that lived on the same street. I never knew what it
was like to live a thousand lives through authors, or what it would have
been like to have a childhood having read Narnia. I never knew what it
was like to be in a STEM program in high school because, though I was
smart I “<a
href="https://youtu.be/xkXpcs_an80?si=bIYeCGobStCNLsCU?utm_source=danielphayward.com">never
applied myself.</a>”</p>
<p>But if you can’t see it, then it isn’t a part of <em>your</em>
umwelt. A mantis shrimp has a wildly different experience than a tuna
fish. The <a
href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/ocean-science-news/peacock-mantis-shrimp?utm_source=danielphayward.com">mantis
shrimp has 16 photoreceptors</a> (humans have 3), they can see UV and
polarized light. If you can’t sense something; it isn’t a part of your
sensed environment. A non-biological example is after my wife and I
bought a Toyota Rav4, I noticed them everywhere. Before having a little
girl, I didn’t notice how people have few boundaries with children (and
often don’t think of them as people).</p>
<p>But you can change part of what you experience by paying attention to
different things. There’s the common saying “<a
href="https://xkcd.com/703/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">you don’t
know what you don’t know</a>,” so how do you pay attention to things you
don’t know about? By having different experiences, learning new
techniques, and best by spending time with different kinds of experts.
We learn to see more like the people we spend time with. You could lurk
in online forums, reading <em>good</em> books, start a new hobby, or put
into practice things you “know.”</p>
<p>The best way to be able to see better is by iterating over a process
and getting feedback. Ideally, the feedback is from an expert, someone
whose judgment you can pull on. If you’re practicing writing, coding, or
creating any kind of document that you can upload to an LLM, then that
works but caveat emptor<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I’d recommend reading Cedric Chin’s “<a
href="https://commoncog.com/how-to-use-ai-without-becoming-stupid/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">How
to Use AI without Becoming Stupid</a>” for a few examples and
exploration of using LLMs well. The gist is that you should not offload
your judgement to an LLM, my opinion is that LLMs will never become
meaning making entities, but they are pushing the boundaries of what
that means and calling into question lots of types of “work.”<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>So go.</p>
<p>Go write a story, work with wood, crochet (or knit, I refuse to know
the difference), draw a seascape, and find someone who lives in that
domain to critique your work.</p>
