that means roughly “sensed environment.” I’d like to take this idea a
little forward, umwelt was first conceived in the world of biology. It
includes the idea of threats and resources but largely refers to what a
creature can sense in a physical domain. In the wikipedia article about
it it also refers to what resources and threats a creature can “see”
based on their experience.</p>
<p>You and I can grow up in the same house, go to the same schools, have
the same parents, but if you and I see the world differently then we
have a different umwelt. You never knew what it was to have an older
sister, or friends that lived on the same street. I never knew what it
was like to live a thousand lives through authors, or what it would have
been like to have a childhood having read Narnia. I never knew what it
was like to be in a STEM program in high school because, though I was
smart I “<a
href="https://youtu.be/xkXpcs_an80?si=bIYeCGobStCNLsCU?utm_source=danielphayward.com">never
applied myself.</a>”</p>
<p>But if you can’t see it, then it isn’t a part of <em>your</em>
umwelt. A mantis shrimp has a wildly different experience than a tuna
fish. The <a
href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/ocean-science-news/peacock-mantis-shrimp?utm_source=danielphayward.com">mantis
shrimp has 16 photoreceptors</a> (humans have 3), they can see UV and
polarized light. If you can’t sense something; it isn’t a part of your
sensed environment. A non-biological example is after my wife and I
bought a Toyota Rav4, I noticed them everywhere. Before having a little
girl, I didn’t notice how people have few boundaries with children (and
often don’t think of them as people).</p>
<p>But you can change part of what you experience by paying attention to
different things. There’s the common saying “<a
href="https://xkcd.com/703/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">you don’t
know what you don’t know</a>,” so how do you pay attention to things you
don’t know about? By having different experiences, learning new
techniques, and best by spending time with different kinds of experts.
We learn to see more like the people we spend time with. You could lurk
in online forums, reading <em>good</em> books, start a new hobby, or put
into practice things you “know.”</p>
<p>The best way to be able to see better is by iterating over a process
and getting feedback. Ideally, the feedback is from an expert, someone
whose judgment you can pull on. If you’re practicing writing, coding, or
creating any kind of document that you can upload to an LLM, then that
works but caveat emptor<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I’d recommend reading Cedric Chin’s “<a
href="https://commoncog.com/how-to-use-ai-without-becoming-stupid/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">How
to Use AI without Becoming Stupid</a>” for a few examples and
exploration of using LLMs well. The gist is that you should not offload
your judgement to an LLM, my opinion is that LLMs will never become
meaning making entities, but they are pushing the boundaries of what
that means and calling into question lots of types of “work.”<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>So go.</p>
<p>Go write a story, work with wood, crochet (or knit, I refuse to know
the difference), draw a seascape, and find someone who lives in that
domain to critique your work.</p>

the Bible this coming year around January.</p>
<p><a href="https://gracecityportland.org/our-team">My pastor</a>
mentioned the best reading plan that he had come across was Robert
Murray’s reading plan. I found a <a
href="https://mcheyne.info/mcheyne-reading-plan/">copy online</a>
included with the reading plan is a warning and encouragement (from
1862), which I had never seen before with a Bible reading plan.</p>
<p>The warning is that by following a reading plan your faith may become
stale, you may become self-righteous or self condemning (different
outcomes of the same belief), and the Word may lose it’s awe-inspiring
nature. I had heard these warnings before or had experience with them
generally.</p>
<p>There are five encouragements two of which I have heard many times,
it is good that we would read through the entire Bible in a year and it
will be easier to open the Bible when you don’t have to decide what to
read.</p>
<p>The other encouragements are about reading in community: people will
have things besides gossip to discuss, parents will know what their
children are reading and can reflect on that with them, the pastor will
be able to preach on what the congregation has been reading, and we will
think of others who we know are reading the same passages as us and will
better be able to pray for them.</p>
<p>At first I thought to myself, “how quaint, thinking that many people
in my close community would be reading the same passages continually.”
It shows how alone I am, and how alone I suspect others are. This is a
reshaped idea of the church calendar. My in-laws go to a liturgical
church and have a pretty good idea of what the sermon will be about
every single week and have for years.</p>
<p>There are positives and negatives to this. From conversations with
them they don’t think that every passage gets attention. But, their
pastors also might have a harder time hiding from preaching on
uncomfortable sections of the Bible.</p>
<p>The pastors also don’t feel any pressure or waste time making sermon
series. Making graphics, three to five alliterative points, or gathering
passages from across the Bible to make a point. The topic is set, so to
speak.</p>
<p>What would it be like to be reading the same passages on a daily
basis as your friends, your family, your pastor.</p>
<p>How much better is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’ve been thinking about the smoking pot and Abraham, isn’t
that so weird.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Why do you think Leviticus is written the way it is?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Why did God ask Abraham why Sarah laughed?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Than:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Did you see the game last night?”</em></li>
<li><em>“How’s work been?”</em></li>
<li><em>“Crazy that the powerball is so high.”</em></li>
<li><em>“It’s awfully warm for January, huh?”</em></li>

are partially or completely built in a factory, compared to the US at
roughly half that.</p>
<p>Brian Potter wrote a <a
href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/should-us-homebuilders-emulate-sweden">thoughtful
essay</a> about prefab homes, it is well worth a read. Why doesn’t the
US have more prefab homes? The gist of it is the cost of Swedish homes
are 70% more than US homes and they aren’t any faster at building them.
When building anything in the US, speed is one of the most important
factors. There are a variety of reasons that prefab homes are still a
good idea for the Swedes (i.e. reducing time on site, quality control)
but he buries the lead.</p>
<p>The cost of building multi family homes was roughly flat from
2017-2023 in Sweden (or decreasing, if you convert it to USD). Even if
this isn’t entirely because of prefabrication, it’s a strong hint that
construction companies in the US should look to for ideas.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Hayward</name></author><category term="non-fiction" /><category term="construction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Sweden 85% of new single family homes and 40% of multifamily homes are partially or completely built in a factory, compared to the US at roughly half that.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PAYSTUB PORTAL</title><link href="https://danielphayward.com/payroll-portal/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PAYSTUB PORTAL" /><published>2026-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielphayward.com/Payroll-Portal</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielphayward.com/payroll-portal/"><![CDATA[<blockquote>

a man uncertain if he was entering a birdhouse or a room packed with
dynamite; he was prepared for either. The minor argument during lunch
hadn’t come to a clear end, leaving the question of whether Lily was
inclined to continue or let it go. She sat in an armchair by the tea
table, her posture stiff; in the subdued light of a December afternoon,
Ethan’s glasses didn’t help much to read her expression.</p>
<p>As a way to ease the tension, he remarked about the soft religious
glow. He or Lily would often make such comments between 4:30 and 6 on
winter evenings; it was part of their married routine. There wasn’t a
customary response to it, but Lily provided none.</p>
<p>Maximus lounged on the Persian rug, enjoying the firelight without
much regard for Lily’s mood. His lineage was as purely Persian as the
rug, and his fur was reaching its peak beauty in its second winter. The
page-boy, who had a penchant for artistic names, had christened him
Maximus. If left to themselves, Ethan and Lily might have chosen
something simpler like Cat, but they weren’t insistent.</p>
<p>Ethan poured himself some tea. Seeing that Lily remained quiet, he
readied himself for another attempt.</p>
<p>“My remark at lunch was more of a hypothetical,” he said. “You seem
to be taking it personally.”</p>
<p>Lily maintained her defensive silence. The bullfinch filled the
silence with a tune from the last drama they had been watching. Ethan
began to feel a bit down. Lily wasn’t sipping her tea. Maybe she wasn’t
feeling well. But Lily was never reserved when feeling unwell; she’d
often declare, “Nobody knows the suffering I endure from indigestion.”
It was one of her favorite lines, though lack of knowledge could only
have been due to not listening. There was enough information about her
indigestion to fill a book.</p>
<p>Yet, Lily didn’t seem unwell.</p>
<p>Ethan began to think he was being treated unfairly; naturally, he
began to make concessions.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” he ventured, taking a central spot on the hearth rug
next to Maximus, “I might be at fault. If it’ll make things better
between us, I’m willing to strive for a better life.”</p>
<p>He wondered vaguely how that would be possible. Temptations came to
him, tentatively and without insistence, like a neglected paperboy
asking for a Christmas tip in February for no better reason than that he
hadn’t received one in December. He had no intention of yielding to them
any more than he intended to buy fish knives or fur scarves that are
advertised year-round. Still, there was something impressive in this
voluntary renunciation of potentially lurking misdeeds.</p>
<p>Lily showed no signs of being impressed.</p>
<p>Ethan looked at her nervously over his glasses. Being on the losing
side of an argument with her was nothing new. Losing while on a
monologue was a new humiliation.</p>
<p>“I’ll go get ready for dinner,” he declared, trying to inject some
sternness into his voice as he reached the door.</p>
<p>At the door, a final pang of weakness made him make one more
plea.</p>
<p>“Aren’t we being a bit silly?”</p>
<p>But Lily still said nothing.</p>
<p>Maximus stretched his velvet paws and hopped onto a bookshelf right
under the bullfinch’s cage. It was the first time he’d seemed to notice
the bird, but he was carrying out a long-held theory with mature
precision. The bullfinch, who had fancied himself a king, suddenly
shrank into a third of his usual size. He began to flutter and chirp
frantically. He had cost twenty-seven shillings, not counting the cage,
but Lily made no move to intervene. She’d been deceased for two
hours.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Hayward</name></author><category term="fiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethan walked into the large, dimly lit living room with the manner of a man uncertain if he was entering a birdhouse or a room packed with dynamite; he was prepared for either.

from Washington to Idaho was because of how much safer it was.</p>
<p>I don’t have any idea if that’s true, the only data they used was
crime and I don’t think crime is the most significant factor for why
people move. I know a dozen people who have moved to Idaho, all of them
quote the same thing (cost of living) and not crime. But that is a
pretty small sample size so caveat emptor.</p>
<p>At first, I didn’t believe the infographic because of how it was
presented (which was misleading) until I looked at the data.</p>
<p>They cited this <a
href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/query">FBI
database</a> as a reference and combined both property and violent crime
as their source. But violent crime and property crime are wildly
different. It’s a different experience for you to be held up at gun
point and having your car stolen. There is also the problem of context.
Most people couldn’t tell you why crimes are per 100,000 population or
if 250 violent crimes per 100,000 people is a lot or not very much. A
single data point just doesn’t really tell you much of anything without
context.</p>
<p>What’s actually more interesting to me is the significant drop in New
York crime from 2021-2022 (that data seems like a mistake somehow) and
the fact that the District of Columbia is so dangerous and in another
world as far as crime goes (25% higher than the next highest point and .
My guess is that DC has many people who are not counted as living there,
but they are physically present. For that same reason, I might expect
Delaware to be unusually low, but it’s not.</p>
<p>But for the years 2016-2024 Idaho has been ranked 8 or lower for the
safest place including both property and violent crime. If you consider
just violent crime Idaho bumps up to 10-12 and Washington goes to the
middle of the pack. Even more interesting is that Washington went ranked
19 in 2016 to 28 in 2024 (for violent crime). That fact is significantly
more noteworthy than that Idaho, which has been safer for as long as
I’ve had data, continues to have less crime than Washington.</p>

increased over time, but the truth is exactly backwards. The story goes
young people can’t afford houses because they have too much fancy
avocado toast, they don’t deprive themselves enough to afford the things
they really want, and get off my lawn!</p>
<p>It can largely be traced back to one statistic, which is produced by
a the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and what’s interesting is
how they collected the data. They’ve been collecting this information
since 1990 and they collect it via 120 mail in survey to home buyers.
Just to spell it out, they mail you a survey (that looks like junk mail)
that you have to physically fill out and then (probably) pay for postage
to send back.</p>
<p>Here’s why I’m saying this is backwards. The <a
href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/">CCP</a> also collects that
information automatically. It includes 5% of all home buyers for the
given period. Instead of increasing from 31 to 40 years old from 2000 to
2025, it’s gone from 38 down to 36. Not as significant a significant
change but one I trust significantly more.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there isn’t an affordability crisis, there
is, which they get into in the American Enterprise Institute’s article
(though I don’t agree with their conclusions).</p>

business before the end of July, we could go another month and hopefully
that would be enough time to get more work for August, maybe there would
be enough time to fix whatever was wrong. I guessed that more
construction owners would be willing to <a
href="https://bryanhendley.medium.com/you-may-make-hay-while-the-sun-shines-but-you-earnyour-money-in-the-rain-49e54b7b3202?utm_source=danielhayward">work
on their business</a> in the fall and not during the summer. That was
our line in the sand.</p>
<p>But then the existing revenue for July evaporated when a project
cancelled. It was my fault, I didn’t follow up when I should have and
their priorities shifted.</p>
<p>I scrambled for a few days but really, I was done.</p>
<p>My sales cycle was too long, the amount I would need almost doubled.
I switched from selling to job hunting.</p>
<p>In September, I started at <a href="https://www.henkels.com/">Henkels
&amp; McCoy</a>. It was a really good fit when I left and still is. I’m
getting my teeth into some complex projects that line up well with my
strengths (not managing sales and technical work at the same time).</p>
<p><a href="https://jamon.dev/">Jamon Holmgren</a> told me after I
started that it would be a struggle to manage getting work and execution
at the same time. Until you have outsource one of those to employees or
contractors it would always be a struggle. He would know, he built his
business in 2008, the most difficult time to do so in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Could we have gone into more debt to try to save the business? Yes,
but even with the debt we accrued, it’s going to be a long time digging
out. I lost faith that my offer addressed a real need in the
marketplace. Or that there was enough demand to support my business. My
standard for confidence in decisions required more evidence than I had.
The entrepreneurial optimistic fog had lifted. Instead of making
assertions, I asked myself, “how do you <em>really</em> know?”</p>
<p>I am, in many ways, an introvert who learned to be extroverted for
work. For the 8 months I was working for myself, my brain didn’t turn
off. I networked in person, and attempted to get a funnel going on LI.
Except at the beginning when things were going extremely well, I was
always thinking about the next deal (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>If I’m more honest with myself, my execution lacked the timeliness
that could have turned good clients into repeating clients. I was given
an opportunity and <a
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A14-30&amp;version=NASB">buried
it in the sand</a>. Even though my customers were understanding, I
missed my standard by a mile.</p>
<p>Did they get what they paid for? Yes, eventually.</p>
<p>One of the main problems is that more than half of my clients were
given to me by one person. <a
href="https://www.joingroundcrew.com">Benjamin Holmgren</a> spent years
building a strong network in construction and deserves all the success
he has. I never put in this kind of work or developed these
relationships prior to going out on my own. Instead of putting the
weight of sales on an unpaid friend, I should have built this pipeline
myself.</p>
<p>Establishing enough trust for deals large enough to make a business
like mine work takes time. Smaller transactions translate to a lower
trust requirement and a shorter amount of time. Getting a deal for $500
is doable but I would have needed 250 projects a year to pay the extra
taxes, cover healthcare, and maintain the same “take-home” pay.</p>
<p>250 projects means a lot of unique requirements, emails, meetings,
file management, invoices, payments etc. $4,000 deals have higher trust
requirements but are more manageable as a workload. Instead of 250
customers a year it’s more like 32.</p>
<p>I had a product that I sold 6 times between December ’24 and March
’25 for $4,000. My hope was to build my business on that.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, I think I could. <em><a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60726415-don-t-believe-everything-you-think?utm_source=danielhayward">But
don’t believe everything you think</a>.</em> Just because something
seems reasonable, just because I can give justification for why it
should work, does not make it so.</p>
<p>If I sold the $4,000 project 3x a month, I was doing well, but I
never hit that. I sold smaller projects to make up the difference and
got feedback from the market. There was not enough demand in my network
or I had not built trust with those people.</p>
<p>I floundered from May to July as even the smaller projects started to
dry up. I was so focused on getting new work I struggled both in
completing the work I did have.</p>
<p>To try to fix the <a
href="https://acsilabs.org/team/lia-a-dibello/">demand side</a> of my
business, I worked through Amy Hoy’s <a
href="https://stackingthebricks.com/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Sales
Safari</a>, started reading the <a
href="http://theheartofinnovationbook.com/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Heart
of Innovation</a> and read about as much as I could by <a
href="commoncog.com?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Cedric Chin</a> about
demand. I knew that I couldn’t exactly explain why the people who bought
from me did. Not with real certainty. I went to construction events in
my area, did online and in person networking, I talked to friends about
their businesses and really went in as many directions as I could,
essentially throwing stuff at the wall to see if anything stuck.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<section id="what-did-i-learn" class="level2">
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>What I’m trying to do here is look for possible outcomes given the
circumstances I saw then and notice now.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Business was great in spring of 2025, I assumed that business
would stay that way and it didn’t. Until you have enough information to
be confident in your causal analysis, ideally using <a
href="xmrit.com?utm_source=danielhayward">xmr charts</a>, you don’t know
anything.</p>
<p>Understanding normal variation for your business and processes is the
only way to make decisions confidently. You can know something tacitly
without going through this process, but that can take years.</p></li>
<li><p>In February, I hired a coach to help me get more customers. He
was expensive and provided little value because I was not measuring him
against anything. I had no specific goal and so we made no
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Recurring costs cost a lot.</p>
<p>The lower recurring costs that you have the more flexibility you
have. Both personally and for the business. With what I was selling, I
could have had minimal overhead, but I added to them with software
subscriptions (software for notetaking, LLM, booking, website, email
etc.). I didn’t have any heuristic for determining whether I should
start a subscription.</p></li>
<li><p>My failures in communication centered around giving bad news.
Communicating well is hard and includes but is not limited to,
responding in a timely manner (but not being always available), reading
/ listening thoroughly, and being clear in your response.</p></li>
<li><p>When I made the decision to work for myself, it was in part
because a good friend looked at my business numbers with me and it was
just staring me in the face, I was making more money with my side
business than my full time job. I couldn’t answer the question, “Why
haven’t you made the jump yet?” Despite my queasy stomach about it, I
went for it. Just because I couldn’t explain why I thought it was a bad
idea, doesn’t mean that it was.</p>
<p>Doesn’t that contradict with #1? Not, it’s a paradox. When you don’t
have data for an intuition and still have to make a decision, how do you
do so? In these low information contexts, just because you don’t’ have a
good explanation doesn’t make the intuition wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://xkcd.com/1032/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Networking</a>
makes me feel like a sleazeball. I don’t like being in rooms where
everyone is shouting over each other and when it’s a quieter space it’s
still uncomfortable. I went to a networking group for about 6 months and
didn’t get any work from it, I enjoyed the people that were there, but I
don’t think it was a good use of my time. Even though it was only 1.5
hours a week, there was travel there and back, often coffee before or
after.</p></li>
<li><p>Selling is hard when it takes any explanation to describe what
you do. I shifted what I told people I did because it was never crystal
clear. Was I a consultant? Did I help construction companies with Excel
problems? Charging $4,000 for an Excel guy is absurd. Did I solve
estimating for growing construction companies? Well, it turns out that
is a very small market and I could never say it straight-faced to
someone I’d never met.</p>
<p>My dad is a mechanic. Everyone he talks to knows two things when he
tells them that. They know if they need help from him and know someone
describes a problem to them, whether he can help.</p></li>

His fingers
brushed the bottom of it as he jumped; the afternoon sun browned his
skin like potatoes in the oven. The tutors allowed them more free time
since summer had started. Or was is something else? The idea of pity,
from other, and for himself occurred to Falcon. It vanished again as he
strained for the apple. He had never seen this orchard before but it was
his, it was all his.</em></p>
<p><em>“Jasha! Lift me up, would you?” Falcon asked.</em></p>
<p>That he hadn’t seen Jasha in months didn’t occur to him; it didn’t
strike Falcon as odd that Jasha stepped out from behind a sapling only
as thick as his wrist.</p>
<p><em>“Sure,” Jasha said smiling.</em></p>
<p><em>Jasha interlocked his fingers and when Falcon stepped onto them
Jasha lifted Falcon quickly above his head, throwing him. Falcon flew,
he plucked the apples off the stems easily but as he tried to drop them
down to Jasha, they floated like him. Some of the fruit looked even
better than what he could see from on the ground. He reached and
strained and floated towards it.</em></p>
<p><em>Jasha laughed, “Would you share please?”</em></p>
<p><em>But when he looked down to Jasha, a full twenty feet down it was
the most natural thing.</em></p>
<p><em>He pushed apples in that direction and they went exactly to
Jasha’s hands. But Falcon rose. He seemed to remember this once before,
almost a deja vu, but more like familiarity, like rowing in a canoe and
matching your strokes with the waves, or the way his father would hit
the red hot metal to make perfect objects. Falcon looked around him,
Jasha now only being a dot in the orchard. At Falcon’s level there was
waves of heat and red speeding towards him. Falcon put up his hands to
stop them and they diverted around. An enormous swath was cut in the red
heat as they went around, joining back up along the horizon on the other
side.</em></p>
<p><em>Falcon tried to look into the distance from above the city,
Elminark, but nothing looked the same, but all still familiar. He didn’t
know what he was searching for, only that he hadn’t found it.</em></p>
<p>Falcon woke up.</p>
<p>His room was large enough for the bed and to walk around. Closed
shutters and curtains blocked out the morning sun. He couldn’t remember
when it had happened, the weeks after mom died, the months since, it was
all a blur.</p>
<p>But no one woke him up anymore.</p>
<p>Plaster walls kept the heat from overwhelming the house in the summer
and thick woven rugs were rolled out in the winter. Falcon went to the
summer bath outside, a metal tub where the cold of the night still held
on, stripped down and plunged in.</p>
<p>Every time, his breath caught.</p>
<p>While sloshing around, he quickly grabbed the wood scraper and drug
it across his skin to get yesterday’s dirt off. His teeth started
chattered and he knew that if he was anything like Darvor, his lips were
purpling. It only took a minute but when he toweled off his skin burnt
with numbness. Ranere called him from the front room.</p>
<p>“Coming,” Falcon called back. “What are you doing! There’s the
execution. You’re going to have to get dressed on the way. I’ve sent Fed
up to grab your clothes.” “I forgot.” “Quickly,” Ranere huffed.</p>
<p>They got in the carriage and Falcon had to dress himself without any
help from Fed, which was hard, especially as they bumped over the
streets of Elminark with dad, Ranere, and Darvor in the carriage.</p>
<p>The market din stopped their conversation. Falcon looked out as they
passed pools and fountains, mostly dedicated to Emperor Ka’de, some to
his predecessors. A painted statue of Ka’de looked over a park of combed
sand, dotted with huge boulders, people rested in the bath at the
center. It was supposed to represent the desert to the south.</p>
<p>They were not yet to the Circle where the execution was being held,
but they stopped.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Dad asked. “There’s some kind of traffic, sir,”
the driver said. “Come on boys, we’re going to be on time.” As they got
out of the carriage Darvor held out his hand. “I’m not a baby, I’m
thirteen Darvor,” Falcon said. “Calm down, baby Falcon,” Darvor said and
rolled his eyes. They walked quickly and Falcon got a little tired and
was momentarily distracted by a shop selling books. “Come on baby
Falcon, fly faster.” Darvor said.</p>
<p>Falcon grimmaced at him. They were through the loudest part of the
city but there were still people with carts and buskers that weren’t
good enough, or strong enough to fight for a spot in the main
market.</p>
<p>They entered the Circle’s ground and three hundred people, most if
not all of the nobles and merchants sat under a rafters that were
cloaked in climbing plants. Fat white, pink, and blue flowers hung in
bunches from the frame. Water bubbled up from fountains between some of
the tables as a cooling feature whenever a breeze would breathe their
way. Some of the families had servants attending them and had fully
settled, conversations between heads of house and the smaller children
were in packs, mostly cousins of a kind, in any case ones that had
shared tutors, Falcon’s tutors anyway.</p>
<p>They started to make their way through the tables towards the only
one that was empty, but was reserved for them. “Falling on hard times
are we?” A man’s voice arrested them as they walked near him. He was a
lean man, tall, but had been in some of the recent wars. His hair,
slicked back and stance was like a lion. Relaxed, but not so relaxed
that he couldn’t spring to fight. “Anayco, how it is to see you,” Dad
said. “And you,” Anayco paused, “Lucky they haven’t started yet. It
would be you next, demeaning the Queen. See your wife again, I suppose,”
he sucked on his teeth at Dad.</p>
<p>Falcon flushed. Ranere tensed but Dad put his hand on Ranere’s
shoulder before he moved and nodded to Anayco.</p>
<p>Anayco stared at him over a nearly empty cup of wine and then turned
his attention to his wife, who sat across the table and resumed whatever
conversation that they had before as they all walked away.</p>
<p>They both wore white clothes with a shock of red sash. As Falcon
glanced over the nobles he saw the same blooms of red on everyone. There
was a section for commoners as well, which he now guessed was the
traffic they ran into, and saw ripped red cloth tied around people’s
arms and around their heads. It was everywhere.</p>
<p>Falcon wanted Anayco dead. No one should talk about his mom like
that; Ranere looked foul. Dad was the only one who wasn’t scowling.</p>
<p>“Father, how are you not enraged?” Ranere demanded. “Because Anayco
is trying to bait me, and generally an ass. Your mother taught me,” his
voice caught, “your mother taught me that this is a game they play here
in Elminark.” “But he doesn’t have a right to say anything about mom!”
Ranere whisper shouted. “He doesn’t. But he also doesn’t have a right to
make me angry, not right now. Do you want to give Anayco more power?
Then give in to your anger. You’ll be completely in his control. Every
Family is here, look around.” Ranere cursed under his breath but Dad
didn’t say anything in response.</p>
<p>The Queen was in Falcon’s line of sight. She was beautiful, even from
here he could see that she had no blemishes on her face or arms. She
wore a white dress with a red thin scarf around her shoulders. The heat
didn’t affect her. The way she held herself was perfectly at ease. Her
laugh carried over the other conversations to his ears. It was a free
and easy laugh that was jarring to Falcon.</p>
<p>These were the same grounds that held races, bow competitions, and
javelin throwing. The oldest and luckiest commoners sat in stands, the
rest stood. A city crier stood in front of the nobles, the conversations
among the nobles stopped and the commoners were told roughly to be
quiet. After the crier explained the men’s crimes, the treasons and
blasphemies against Ka’de, he stepped aside for a priest.</p>
<p>“The sins that these men committed results in their death. Beware
that the path you are not does not lead the same way. Let all be in the
light, only do not hide your deeds, do not hide your neighbor’s deeds,
all is known in the end,” the large priest said and then motioned to the
crier.</p>
<p>The first man was given a plate. His hands shook as he brought it to
his mouth. He had a last moment to be submissive, but could not between
shaking hands and urging of the priest and crier who were with him. The
crowd hissed at him and shouted. A block was brought out an an axe split
his head from his shoulders. It rolled a few feet and blood spilled.</p>
<p>Two young men, not much older than Ranere picked up the head by the
hair and threw the body into a rolling cart. They were not disgusted;
death was their trade.</p>
<p>“Dad, why do we have to be here?” Falcon asked. “Because the queen
commanded it. No more Falcon, not now.” Falcon nodded.</p>
<p>After they had watched five more men die, one ate what was offered on
the plate at then climbed into the cart and shook as death took him and
the crowd hissed and roared at the deaths in front of them, there was
entertainment of a lighter nature. Jugglers, acrobats, minstrels,
hawkers brought food to the masses while chefs managed to keep their
meals beautiful to bring to the nobles.</p>
<p>Darvor sat and watched, staring.</p>
<p>There were plenty of people Falcon knew. That he could talk with;
Anria and Av’lan, both Falcon’s age sat at a nearby table. But he didn’t
want to. Except those affiliated with the temple, marked by their white
clothes and something garishly red.</p>
<p>A table neighbor, Bames was talking with Dad, another head of
household.</p>
<p>Falcon drifted off until Queen Barra silenced everyone by standing.
Waiting only a moment, Falcon looked at her fully. Grey fabric, embedded
with lace and something crystalline, wrapped her except her arms, which
were bare. A diadem of silver encircled her dark, done up hair.</p>
<p>Unlike the crier, she hardly spoke up. Her voice carried over that
silent assemblage, “Emperor Ka’de is visiting in a month’s time. I will
be meeting with each of your families between now and then. There is
concern about the faithfulness of the city. You my children, I know you
will not disappoint. I know that if there is any unfaithfulness, you
will root it out. That your lives support your Queen Mother. If there is
any concern, please bring it to my attention. Go, cleanse yourselves if
necessary, only do not hide what you have done, or what your neighbors
have done.” She waved and sat down.</p>
<p>The performers who had started before the city crier resumed and
music floated on the heat of the afternoon. After another quarter of an
hour Dad stood to exit as to not be the first.</p>
<p>As they boarded their carriage, Falcon looked at the nobles still
gathered. It was fiercely beautiful, gardens stark in a barren land. The
waters they had to bring for just the hanging baskets was an immense
work, besides the care and cultivation of all the plants in the
ground.</p>
<p>“Dad, what’s happening?” Falcon asked. “Wait until we get home.” Dad
looked at Falcon. Falcon watched the city roll by on wheels over stones.
Ranere looked at him and gave him an understanding look that said they’d
talk at home. At home Dad disappeared into his workshop. The forge had
been kept on for him and despite the heat Falcon heard the furnace kick
up. Ranere took him aside and asked, “Is everything alright?”
“Everything’s fine. I just, I had a dream about Jasha again.” “Oh.”
Ranere tried to smile, but it was strained. “Why don’t you go do
something?” “Nothing sounds exciting.” “Well, then sit and do nothing,
see if that helps.” “Ranere, why did you ask if you didn’t want to
hear?” “I’m sorry Falcon. It’s hard. You’re right he’s gone, but
sometimes you just have to be strong. You can’t always look back, you’ve
got to move on.” Falcon had tears brim in his eyes but he looked away
and when Ranere reached out he hit his hand away and stalked off.
“Falcon, come back,” Ranere called after him but let him go.</p>
<p>Falcon walked out of the house and left the grounds. The gates of
steel were surrounded by the same stone that the roads were made of, a
beige flat stone that broke apart in flakes when it was struck.</p>
<p>The city, in the heat, was quiet. Only the baths would be busy now.
He wrapped a scarf around over his head to keep the heat off and his
eyes from getting tired of the brightness. Sweat dried faster than it
could cool him; he stopped sweating. The cool of the shade from palm
trees surprised him as he went from each one to the next, switching
sides of the street to hit them.</p>
<p>He was still in the upper district, but he didn’t recognize any of
the houses. The anger for Ranere had burned off and finally he was
anxious to be home, no matter how stupid Ranere was. Finally, the gate
in front of a house seemed familiar. It was Gralia’s home. She was one
of the girls that he had tutored with under master Plet.</p>
<p>Before he could decide what to do Gralia called his name, “Falcon?”
“Hello.” Falcon said. “What are you doing in the heat?” She called to
him and gestured for him to come through the gate. A verdant garden
inside the gates with a pool of water for the plants to drink from. Next
to her, in the shade, was a pitcher with water. “You look thirsty, do
you want some?” Gralia gestured, and poured him a glass when he nodded.
The dryness of his throat finally abated, he could feel the coolness in
his belly. He had a second cup, greedily.</p>
<p>Ampo walked up from the house, and three others, looking at him. Ampo
smiled, “Falcon, welcome.” It was not a kind smile. Falcon realized in
the disappointment in his stomach that he wanted to spend time alone
with Gralia, “I didn’t mean to interrupt. I can leave,” Falcon
hesitated, starting to turn, “Thank you for the water.” “No
interruption,” Ampo said looking down at Falcon, “We were just going to
play a game.” “What game?” “Snake.” “What’s that?” Gralia laughed when
he asked, “No Ampo, come on.” It seemed so sweet, Falcon didn’t
recognize it for the same smile as Ampo had given him. “It’s super easy.
Do you want to play?” “Maybe I can watch you guys play,” Falcon said,
starting to turn around. “No, that kind of defeats the purpose, you’ll
catch on really quick. Promise,” Ampo said and grabbed his shoulder.
Ampo was a full head taller and his muscles had developed more than
Falcon’s. “Here’s what we do, we find a hole and then you pretend your a
snake, you just wriggle your way through, sound fun?” “No, Ampo. I
didn’t mean anything, I was just lost. I’ll go now,” Falcon said and
started to walk off, back into the sun. “We should find a small hole
because you’re small. Very small,” Ampo said looking at Falcon closely.
He grabbed Falcon and picked him up, on the other side of the fence in
the back there was a dry well. Falcon yelled as Ampo and another kid
threw him in. He grabbed a rope as he fell and righted himself, but
still scraped down the walls. The dust settled and he looked up into the
light above, a perfect circle. Blood oozed out of his knees and elbows.
Falcon picked rocks out of the pads of his hands, tears leaking but he
wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of hearing him cry.</p>
<p><em>Burn them till they’re ash.</em></p>
<p>“Fly out of the hole, little birdie,” Ampo called, laughing. “Let me
out!” He couldn’t keep his voice from shaking. “Maybe later,” Ampo said
and then it was quiet. Falcon felt his heart beat in his chest. He was
sweating again but compared to the heat of the afternoon, this was cool.
Falcon sat and just breathed.</p>
<p>As his eyes adjusted he found why the the well was dry. There was a
crack in the wall, and the rocks had split, revealing a cave. A poor
place to dig a well, it may have never been used that way. He strained
his eyes and could see, but barely. The light from above was still
enough for Falcon do get through the crack. The scrapes burned for
another minute as he let himself get distracted.</p>
<p><em>Won’t leave without a knife again.</em> Falcon thought as he
squeezed himself through the cave. It was even cooler and as he strained
his eyes further there was still a way to move forward. The cave opened
up into a large cavern., that eventually led to a stream. It smelled
almost of mold, but the relief from the heat was immense. As he walked
further from the crack, even though he could not discern any light
source, he still saw everything in shades of grey.</p>
<p>After wandering for an hour in one long lava tube, the greys resolved
into browns and the cave’s opening was ahead.</p>
<p>The heat of the afternoon had lessened with the sun out of it’s
zenith and as Falcon approached Elminark, he was in its shadows. The
streets grew in busyness as people left the baths and resumed their
work, some were home for dinner and more than once kids stopped playing
when he approached to stare at him. He was wearing very different
clothes than they, who had hardly more than rags.</p>
<p>Inside his home’s grounds, he saw a litter in the front and two
carriages. Someone important was at the house and Falcon had no patience
for it. He snuck around to the back and grabbed some fruit and a
water-skin from the servants entrance without the cook seeing him and
went to the garden in the shade.</p>
<p>When he walked inside Ranere confronted him, “Where have you been?”
“Around,” Falcon stepped to the side to go upstairs but Ranere mirrored
him. “Queen Baurra requested to see you.” “What?” Falcon said stopping.
“You were the only one gone, she said she was meeting with all the noble
homes.” “Why are you joking!” “I’m not joking, come on,” Ranere grabbed
Falcon’s hand and led him to the sitting room where there were a three
attendants and the Queen sitting their. Falcon had never been at an
event where the Queen was, though Dad and Mom had, before… “Ah, my Queen
Mother. This is my youngest son who I spoke of.” She looked at him and
smiled, “How good to meet you, Falcon is it?” Falcon nodded and
hesitantly bowed and then decided to kneel halfway through, “I’m
hon–thank you, yes.” Queen Barra laughed a little, “A young lord indeed.
Falcon, what do you think is the worst, a merchant who doesn’t pay
proper taxes, or his friend who hides it?” “The one who doesn’t pay his
taxes?” “No. It is the one who doesn’t speak up. There will always be
those who do what they ought not, they are always found out eventually.
It is the one who doesn’t say anything because they are never found out
for their transgression,” she said.</p>
<p>She looked away and dismissed Falcon as well as Ranere. The
attendants and Father spoke for another hour into the evening and drank
cooled wine as the sun set, just before true darkness settled, the men
in the litter carried the Queen away and the carriages clattered
off.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Hayward</name></author><category term="fiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Falcon reached for the apple, just out of reach.

He had never seen this orchard before but it was his, it was all his.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Statistics are (Mostly) Useless</title><link href="https://danielphayward.com/useless-statistics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Statistics are (Mostly) Useless" /><published>2025-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://danielphayward.com/Useless-Statistics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielphayward.com/useless-statistics/"><![CDATA[<p>Follow the money.</p>

<p>Statistics, numbers and graphs are used to tell a story. If you get
to choose the size of your audience; 200,000 or 200,000,000 which would
you choose? That is 1,000x difference between these two and for the
table above, between Clark County today and the New York Times, it’s
6,158x for monthly web visitors.</p>
<p>It seems to me almost all of the conversation, in most areas focuses
on larger areas. It’s just as easy to get statistics from smaller locals
but people don’t because it doesn’t make as much money. They can sell it
everywhere (including internationally) whereas a story that is focused
on Portland, OR isn’t going to sell in New York City or even Seattle,
WA, (despite their proximity).</p>
<p>So while it’s not a physics reason (like with radio and broadcast tv
in the 1970s), it is almost as universally true based on the models of
revenue.</p>
<p>National statistics are as useful to an individual as making
decisions based off world statistics. The group is just too large to be
meaningful unless you’re making decisions at that level (for example,
thinking about a national health program, or a national law).</p>
<p>When you hear about national unemployment rates that’s almost
meaningless compared to the unemployment rate of the closest big city.
Same for house prices, inflation, and income. I don’t know when it
started, but averages just aren’t useful. American’s households on
average own 4.4 Bibles, if you walk your neighborhood, you won’t find
one house that owns 4.4 Bibles. I don’t even know that you would find
very many who own 4 or 5.</p>
<p>Statistics and averages can serve many different narratives about all
the things that are going wrong, depending on what story you want to
write.</p>
<p>What’s the alternative?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore national statistics except for ones that are only produced
nationally (ie: Fed Rate, total money in the economy)</li>
<li>Find local supplier indicators (RMLS sold, scrap metal prices,
random length, a supplier who produces it monthly, you know your
business better than I do)</li>
<li>Find your local unemployment numbers, by industry</li>
<li>Go beyond the average and how these affect your business</li>
</ul>
<p>After you’ve been doing this for a year, test business decisions
against data you’re seeing, write down why you’re making the decisions
and what effect you thought would occur.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daniel Hayward</name></author><category term="non-fiction" /><category term="essay" /><category term="business" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Follow the money.]]></summary></entry></feed>
