        <h1>Deficit of Attention</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Killian wandered the aisles in the garage.<br> One bay door was open,
releasing dusty air and replacing it with fresh, sunshine air.<br> There
was an organized madness to the garage. Anal retentive maybe, but easily
distracted also was the soul that was reflected in this space.<br>
“What’s that?” Killian asked, pointing to an object on a shelf with his
clipboard.<br> Brandon walked over to it. “Ping pong set. Two paddles in
cases and bundled up with stands”<br> “When did you last play ping pong
it?”<br> “Three months ago.”<br> “Did you use any of this?”<br> Brandon
shook his head. He was a squat man with a wide forehead. He had thin
blonde hair cropped close, almost military. Turning the ping pong
paddles over, he set them back.<br> Killian made a mark on his
clipboard. “When was the last time you used these to play table
tennis?”<br> “It would have been, at least a year ago maybe longer,”
Brandon answered.<br> Killian made another note on his clipboard.”When
was the last time you went bicycling?“<br>”In college.”<br> “Did you
live here when you were in college?”<br> “No.”<br> “Have you ever used
this bicycle?”<br> “Well, I lived closer to my work when I started
buying–”<br> “Sorry, when was the last time you used this bicycle?”<br>
“I haven’t.” Killian walked over and opened up the bag next to it.<br>
“You have a stand for it. A reasonable lock. Do you have bicycling
specific clothes?”<br> “No.” Killian marked down on his clipboard.<br>
“Yes. I have bicycling clothes.” Killian made another mark.<br>
“Camping?” <br> “Last summer but I’ve been hiking this spring.”<br>
“Concrete stuff?” <br> “Never.” After each question Killian made a mark
on his clipboard. <br> “Skiing?” <br> “I got a good deal.” Killian
raised made the same mark he had been making.<br> “Do you work on your
car yourself or have a shop do most of it?” He asked pointing at the
rolling toolbox. <br> “Dealer warranty still.” Killian sighed. <br>
“What do you do with your time?”<br> “Internet? I mean, I cook and clean
and work. That takes a lot of time.”<br> “I see. Well,” Killian said
writing some notes as he spoke, “I’m cancelling your Amazon Prime
account and perscribing long form reading for an hour a day. Also, go
for walks without listening to anything. You also need to pick one of
the hobbies from this room and get rid of the rest. Pick something
you’ll actually do.”<br> “But,” he was cut off.”Do you want to get
better or make excuses? Did you come to me to get better or to say the
same?“<br>”To get better.”<br> “Then try what I say. Besides if you get
half of what you paid for for all of this,” Killian said waving to the
amagalm of dead hobbies, “You’ll more than pay for my fee.”</p>
