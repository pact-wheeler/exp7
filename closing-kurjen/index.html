        <h1>Closing kurjen</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Maybe you noticed, maybe you didn’t, I closed kurjen.</p>
<p>In July my wife and I had a hard conversation. A half dozen projects
were “only a week or two away” for months but never <em>quite</em>
ready.</p>
<p>The sum of the conversation we had was: if I could make $4,000 of new
business before the end of July, we could go another month and hopefully
that would be enough time to get more work for August, maybe there would
be enough time to fix whatever was wrong. I guessed that more
construction owners would be willing to <a
href="https://bryanhendley.medium.com/you-may-make-hay-while-the-sun-shines-but-you-earnyour-money-in-the-rain-49e54b7b3202?utm_source=danielhayward">work
on their business</a> in the fall and not during the summer. That was
our line in the sand.</p>
<p>But then the existing revenue for July evaporated when a project
cancelled. It was my fault, I didn’t follow up when I should have and
their priorities shifted.</p>
<p>I scrambled for a few days but really, I was done.</p>
<p>My sales cycle was too long, the amount I would need almost doubled.
I switched from selling to job hunting.</p>
<p>In September, I started at <a href="https://www.henkels.com/">Henkels
&amp; McCoy</a>. It was a really good fit when I left and still is. I’m
getting my teeth into some complex projects that line up well with my
strengths (not managing sales and technical work at the same time).</p>
<p><a href="https://jamon.dev/">Jamon Holmgren</a> told me after I
started that it would be a struggle to manage getting work and execution
at the same time. Until you have outsource one of those to employees or
contractors it would always be a struggle. He would know, he built his
business in 2008, the most difficult time to do so in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Could we have gone into more debt to try to save the business? Yes,
but even with the debt we accrued, it’s going to be a long time digging
out. I lost faith that my offer addressed a real need in the
marketplace. Or that there was enough demand to support my business. My
standard for confidence in decisions required more evidence than I had.
The entrepreneurial optimistic fog had lifted. Instead of making
assertions, I asked myself, “how do you <em>really</em> know?”</p>
<p>I am, in many ways, an introvert who learned to be extroverted for
work. For the 8 months I was working for myself, my brain didn’t turn
off. I networked in person, and attempted to get a funnel going on LI.
Except at the beginning when things were going extremely well, I was
always thinking about the next deal (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>If I’m more honest with myself, my execution lacked the timeliness
that could have turned good clients into repeating clients. I was given
an opportunity and <a
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A14-30&amp;version=NASB">buried
it in the sand</a>. Even though my customers were understanding, I
missed my standard by a mile.</p>
<p>Did they get what they paid for? Yes, eventually.</p>
<p>One of the main problems is that more than half of my clients were
given to me by one person. <a
href="https://www.joingroundcrew.com">Benjamin Holmgren</a> spent years
building a strong network in construction and deserves all the success
he has. I never put in this kind of work or developed these
relationships prior to going out on my own. Instead of putting the
weight of sales on an unpaid friend, I should have built this pipeline
myself.</p>
<p>Establishing enough trust for deals large enough to make a business
like mine work takes time. Smaller transactions translate to a lower
trust requirement and a shorter amount of time. Getting a deal for $500
is doable but I would have needed 250 projects a year to pay the extra
taxes, cover healthcare, and maintain the same “take-home” pay.</p>
<p>250 projects means a lot of unique requirements, emails, meetings,
file management, invoices, payments etc. $4,000 deals have higher trust
requirements but are more manageable as a workload. Instead of 250
customers a year it’s more like 32.</p>
<p>I had a product that I sold 6 times between December ’24 and March
’25 for $4,000. My hope was to build my business on that.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, I think I could. <em><a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60726415-don-t-believe-everything-you-think?utm_source=danielhayward">But
don’t believe everything you think</a>.</em> Just because something
seems reasonable, just because I can give justification for why it
should work, does not make it so.</p>
<p>If I sold the $4,000 project 3x a month, I was doing well, but I
never hit that. I sold smaller projects to make up the difference and
got feedback from the market. There was not enough demand in my network
or I had not built trust with those people.</p>
<p>I floundered from May to July as even the smaller projects started to
dry up. I was so focused on getting new work I struggled both in
completing the work I did have.</p>
<p>To try to fix the <a
href="https://acsilabs.org/team/lia-a-dibello/">demand side</a> of my
business, I worked through Amy Hoy’s <a
href="https://stackingthebricks.com/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Sales
Safari</a>, started reading the <a
href="http://theheartofinnovationbook.com/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Heart
of Innovation</a> and read about as much as I could by <a
href="commoncog.com?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Cedric Chin</a> about
demand. I knew that I couldn’t exactly explain why the people who bought
from me did. Not with real certainty. I went to construction events in
my area, did online and in person networking, I talked to friends about
their businesses and really went in as many directions as I could,
essentially throwing stuff at the wall to see if anything stuck.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<section id="what-did-i-learn" class="level2">
<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<p>What I’m trying to do here is look for possible outcomes given the
circumstances I saw then and notice now.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Business was great in spring of 2025, I assumed that business
would stay that way and it didn’t. Until you have enough information to
be confident in your causal analysis, ideally using <a
href="xmrit.com?utm_source=danielhayward">xmr charts</a>, you don’t know
anything.</p>
<p>Understanding normal variation for your business and processes is the
only way to make decisions confidently. You can know something tacitly
without going through this process, but that can take years.</p></li>
<li><p>In February, I hired a coach to help me get more customers. He
was expensive and provided little value because I was not measuring him
against anything. I had no specific goal and so we made no
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Recurring costs cost a lot.</p>
<p>The lower recurring costs that you have the more flexibility you
have. Both personally and for the business. With what I was selling, I
could have had minimal overhead, but I added to them with software
subscriptions (software for notetaking, LLM, booking, website, email
etc.). I didn’t have any heuristic for determining whether I should
start a subscription.</p></li>
<li><p>My failures in communication centered around giving bad news.
Communicating well is hard and includes but is not limited to,
responding in a timely manner (but not being always available), reading
/ listening thoroughly, and being clear in your response.</p></li>
<li><p>When I made the decision to work for myself, it was in part
because a good friend looked at my business numbers with me and it was
just staring me in the face, I was making more money with my side
business than my full time job. I couldn’t answer the question, “Why
haven’t you made the jump yet?” Despite my queasy stomach about it, I
went for it. Just because I couldn’t explain why I thought it was a bad
idea, doesn’t mean that it was.</p>
<p>Doesn’t that contradict with #1? Not, it’s a paradox. When you don’t
have data for an intuition and still have to make a decision, how do you
do so? In these low information contexts, just because you don’t’ have a
good explanation doesn’t make the intuition wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://xkcd.com/1032/?utm_source=danielphayward.com">Networking</a>
makes me feel like a sleazeball. I don’t like being in rooms where
everyone is shouting over each other and when it’s a quieter space it’s
still uncomfortable. I went to a networking group for about 6 months and
didn’t get any work from it, I enjoyed the people that were there, but I
don’t think it was a good use of my time. Even though it was only 1.5
hours a week, there was travel there and back, often coffee before or
after.</p></li>
<li><p>Selling is hard when it takes any explanation to describe what
you do. I shifted what I told people I did because it was never crystal
clear. Was I a consultant? Did I help construction companies with Excel
problems? Charging $4,000 for an Excel guy is absurd. Did I solve
estimating for growing construction companies? Well, it turns out that
is a very small market and I could never say it straight-faced to
someone I’d never met.</p>
<p>My dad is a mechanic. Everyone he talks to knows two things when he
tells them that. They know if they need help from him and know someone
describes a problem to them, whether he can help.</p></li>
