Sales Safari

Take a piece of paper, or open a new document in your favorite note-taking app. Do not optimize this process. Do not have an LLM do it for you, you prompt an LLM to critique your finished work.

Write the following headings or break your page into the following headings:

Rough notes - anything important that doesn't fit into the following headings.
Pains - List all the pains that folks imply or talk about in the sales call or forum thread
Worldview - This is one of the trickiest elements of Sales Safari, but also one of the most important, how do these people approach the world. Just try your best, have someone critique you, have an LLM critique you.
Jargon - Any word or phrase used specific to an industry
Recommendations - When people talk about pains, they tend to also talk about solutions

After going through the forum or sales call with what you've learned going under these headings, save it in a folder and reference it when considering your product. Ask yourself thoughtful questions. Write emails and copy that directly addresses these pains. If it's a forum, have an LLM compare your analysis with the text, see if it comes up with anything more. If it's a sales call, use Vibe to create a transcript and do the same thing.

How do you find a forum if you don't have sales calls to reference? Using a search engine, google forums related to your topic. If you have direct competitors, go to their website to see if they have a forum, people love to complain. It could be an amazon product review page. Use your imagination.

The customer does not care about your writing, or about your product. A customer does not buy your product because they like your product. A customer buys your product because they believe it will turn them into a more awesome version of themselves.
