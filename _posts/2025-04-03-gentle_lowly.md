## Summary
The main point of Gentle and Lowly by Dane Ortlund is that Christ's heart is gentle and lowly [^1], that is primarily who Christ is. It is the spring that all other attributes of Christ flow from.

[^1]: surprise! given the title

This is something that American Christians get wrong. When we see the wrath of God and we think it comes from a holiness of heart[^2], we must ask what is wrath? What is anger for? Why would someone flip tables?

[^2]: and God is holy, the main criticism that I found of this book is that somehow Dane Ortlund takes away God's holiness by insisting that his heart is always only ever tender towards his children, even when He is angry, it is out of love. 

Primarily for protection. 

My toddler daughter was almost run over by someone biking. Even though I am tender towards her largely, that's where most of my actions come from, when I believed she was going to be harmed, I seemed angry. And that is good.

If God is the tender, gentle, lover of my soul then how does wrath fit in? How does Jealousy? How does holiness? It is out of a desire for the beloved[^3] in a "for us not against us" kind of way. 

[^3]: me, you, the Church but not in an objectifying way, see Genesis 5


So all of these attributes flow from the gentle and lowly humility. 

Humility that would talk to the woman at the well. Humility that would let the woman wash his feet with her tears. That would say "let the one without sin throw the first stone." That would draw the children to himself and rebuke his disciples for preventing them. 

Humility that would look at the rich young ruler or crowds of thousands and have compassion. That would weep with Lazarus' sisters at his death. 

Humility that would look at Jerusalem and cry. That would have him wash his disciples' feet, even Judas's. That would have Christ give up his life in a completely debasing way. That would invite the thief to paradise. That would care for his mother while dying. That would pray the psalms while dying and with his last breath forgive his murderers.

## Response
So then, how should we live? Similarly, gentle and lowly. The wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God. Do you want to know who Jesus flips tables at? It's not the liberals. It is not people who are "ruining this country," it isn't the foreigner or immigrant. It is people who take his name in vain, not people who use God's name as a swear word. People who claim to love God but don't care for the poor. Who justify means by the "end"[^4]. Who don't love the widows and orphans. Who trample other image bearers. It's people who insist on protecting themselves instead of sacrificing the way Christ did. 

[^4]: hint: the ends *never* justify the means

Is there room for anger and rage? Hell yeah, but not because the republicans or democrats got an election they shouldn't have. Your enemies aren't political, your enemies are agents of Satan[^5] and they are spiritual. Gird your loins, take the correction. I am preaching to myself.

[^5]: literally, the opponent

## Questions
Should we be as gentle and lowly as Christ, is there such a thing as too gentle and lowly? Paul seems combative in his letters, how do we make sure that our hearts are gentle and lowly as Christ's? Can you change your heart if it isn't gentle and lowly? How does one have a change of heart?
