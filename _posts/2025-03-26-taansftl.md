> “Oh, *Tanstaafl* means there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. And isn't," I added, pointing to a FREE LUNCH sign across room," or these drinks would cost half as much. Was reminding her that anything free costs twice as much in long run or turns out worthless.”

I have more paid apps on my phone than anyone else I know. If I'm not paying for something I'm using, either someone is doing me a favor or I'm the product. When I don't understand how something is profitable, I'm wary of using it.

I've recently switched to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), a paid email service. And you're reading this on a website that is included in the cost to have my own email + the $12 a year that it costs from to register it at [BookMyName](https://www.bookmyname.com/), but I wouldn't recommend them despite the price. Including the email service it works about to about $72/yr and the main competitor to this is Squarespace which is ~$192 a year. And that's the cheapest option, for businesses it's another $5/mo to be able to use all of their features, and another $10/mo to use their mail. No wonder they advertise on every single podcast.

But back to my phone, my apps are: 

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [Timery](https://timeryapp.com/)
- [Yomu](https://www.yomu-reader.com/)

The rest of the apps on my phone are a mix of services that allow me to pay the company (payment model is obvious there) or open sourced. 

As I was writing this I just realized I <u>never</u> see (I do hear them when listening to podcasts) any ads on my phone unless I'm on Safari which is [rare](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1727/1727-h/1727-h.htm#chap12), as it is disabled almost all of the time. 

Switching away from Google can be difficult, but [Google's list of privacy concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google) is long and obvious when you look at [incentives](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/). They make more money when they are better able to advertise to you. The same is true with [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), & [X](https://twitter.com/?lang=en), you might think of them as a search engine, a store, or social media; they are the same way that a ranch farmer is a day care for cows. 

Do they offer services to the cows? Absolutely. 

> Rest assured, my love for you and your love for me are as like as two peas. I have always desired you, as you (pitiful fool) desired me. The difference is that I am the stronger. I think they will give you to me now; or a bit of you. Love you? Why, yes. As dainty a morsel as ever I grew fat on.

Do they care for the cows? It depends on what you mean when you ask that question. They care for the cows the way a diner wants their steak to be of high quality, not the way a friend cares for your well being.

As I navigate the digital world, I try to be highly aware of who gets the money, because every dollar is a vote. 

Work with companies you want to work with.
