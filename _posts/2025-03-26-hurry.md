"Why don't you hurry!"

Death waits for no man but I'll be damned if I rush to meet him. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. 

I've no mind to rush. Motion is not progress. I will plod along at th epace I am going because I know no mistakes will dog my heels. I will not circle back and around again to make it right.

When I was young I thought and acted like a child, but now childish ways are left for the children.

My thoughts race before me making ten mistakes before I take a misstep. In this way I have died ten thousand deaths. Before my race is finished I expect as many again. 

Death has courted me these many years and you ask why don't I rush.
