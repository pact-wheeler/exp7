My pastor today preached on the ten commandments. It was a banger but sometimes there's a quick aside, a word of explanation that is aside from the main point that is wrong. Obviously, I'm not going to be asinine and point it out to him, after the fact. I don't want him to know I actually listen.

Did David sin when he pretended to be insane? Or did Nathan sin when he deceived David that he was talking about someone else?

Did the left handed assassin sin when he killed the king of Judah?

Did Joseph sin when he deceived his brothers and wrongly accused his youngest brother Benjamin of stealing?

Did the Midwives in Egypt sin when they told Pharoah that they couldn't kill the Jewish babies?

Asian descent. Would that have been a sin?
